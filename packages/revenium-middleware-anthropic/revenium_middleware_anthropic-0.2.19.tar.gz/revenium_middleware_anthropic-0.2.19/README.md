A middleware library for metering and monitoring Anthropic API usage in Python applications. üêç‚ú®

## ‚ú® Features

- **üìä Precise Usage Tracking**: Monitor tokens, costs, and request counts across all Anthropic API endpoints
- **üîå Seamless Integration**: Drop-in middleware that works with minimal code changes
- **‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Configuration**: Customize metering behavior to suit your application needs

## üì• Installation

```bash
pip install revenium-middleware-anthropic
```

## üîß Usage

### üîÑ Zero-Config Integration

Simply export your REVENIUM_METERING_API_KEY and import the middleware.
Your Anthropic calls will be metered automatically:

```python
import anthropic
import revenium_middleware_anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=20000,
    temperature=1,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                     "text": "What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?",
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
```

The middleware automatically intercepts Anthropic API calls and sends metering data to Revenium without requiring any
changes to your existing code. Make sure to set the `REVENIUM_METERING_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication
with the Revenium service.

### üìà Enhanced Tracking with Metadata

For more granular usage tracking and detailed reporting, add the `usage_metadata` parameter:

```python
import anthropic
import revenium_middleware_anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    max_tokens=20000,
    temperature=1,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?",
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    usage_metadata={
         "trace_id": "conv-28a7e9d4",
         "task_type": "summarize-customer-issue",
         "subscriber": {
             "id": "subscriberid-1234567890",
             "email": "user@example.com",
             "credential": {
                 "name": "engineering-api-key",
                 "value": "sk-ant-api03-..."
             }
         },
         "organization_id": "acme-corp",
         "subscription_id": "startup-plan-Q1",
         "product_id": "saas-app-gold-tier",
         "agent": "support-agent",
    }
)
print(message.content)
```

### üîÑ Streaming Support

The middleware also supports Anthropic's streaming API. For streaming responses, use the `usage_context` to set metadata before making the streaming call. The middleware will automatically track token usage and send metering data when the stream completes.

```python
import anthropic
from revenium_middleware_anthropic import usage_context

usage_context.set({
    "agent": "network-traffic-analyzer",
    "subscriber_email": "ai@revenium.io",
    "organization_id": "devops-team-emea",
})

with client.messages.stream(
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
) as stream:
    for text in stream.text_stream:
        print("\n>>>" + text, end="", flush=True)

```


#### üè∑Ô∏è Metadata Fields
