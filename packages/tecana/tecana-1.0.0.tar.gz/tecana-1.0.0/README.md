## Tecana - Technical Analysis Library

A high-performance Python library for technical analysis of financial markets, optimized for speed and efficiency.

## Features

- 60+ technical indicators with optimized implementations
- Trading signals derived from indicators (momentum, zone, trend, volatility)
- Simple, consistent API with pandas integration
- Minimal dependencies (just numpy and pandas)
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

```bash
pip install tecana
```
Quick Start
```
import tecana as ta
import pandas as pd
```
## Load your OHLCV data
```
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
```
## Calculate single indicators
```
df = ta.rsi(df)
df = ta.macd(df)
```
## Apply multiple indicators efficiently in one call
```
df = ta.custom(df,
    ['rsi', 14],              # With specific parameter
    ['macd', 12, 26, 9],      # With multiple parameters
    ['bb', {'window': 20}],   # With keyword arguments
    ['atr']                   # With default parameters
)
```
## Calculate trading signals
```
df = ta.rsi_m(df)  # Momentum signal
df = ta.rsi_z(df)  # Zone signal (overbought/oversold)
df = ta.rsi_t(df)  # Trend signal
```
