## 1. Overview

Pyon is a Python library that extends the JSON format to support a broader set of Python-native data types, including sets, tuples, enums, user-defined classes, and structures from libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

It provides a serialization and deserialization mechanism that preserves the structure and type information of supported objects using additional metadata embedded in standard JSON.

Pyon was designed with the following principles:

- **JSON-valid output**: All serialized data is valid JSON and can be parsed by any standard JSON parser.
- **Type preservation**: Encoded objects retain enough metadata to be accurately reconstructed as their original Python types.
- **Modular architecture**: Support for data types is implemented through independent encoders, allowing structured maintenance and future expansion.

Pyon is suitable for tasks such as storing structured data, saving configurations, exporting Python objects for inspection or reuse, and ensuring deterministic reconstruction across environments ‚Äî provided that all involved types are supported.

---
<br>

## 2. Simplified Interface

Pyon provides a straightforward interface with four main methods:

- **`encode(obj)`**: Serializes a Python object into a Pyon string.
- **`decode(data)`**: Deserializes a Pyon string into the corresponding Python object.
- **`to_file(obj, file_path)`**: Serializes a Python object and saves the result to a file.
- **`from_file(file_path)`**: Loads data from a file and deserializes it into the corresponding Python object.

Each of these methods automatically detects the data type and applies the appropriate serialization or deserialization logic.
<br>

### Additional options
Additional options are available in the core encoding methods:

| Method         | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `encode(...)`  | Serializes an object to a Pyon string                 |
| `to_file(...)` | Saves a serialized object to disk                     |

These methods accept two optional parameters:

- `enc_protected=True` includes attributes starting with `_` in the serialization.
- `enc_private=True` includes name-mangled attributes starting with `__` in the serialization.

---
<br>

## 3. Supported Types

Pyon supports a broad array of Python types out-of-the-box:
<br/>

**1. Base Types**
- `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `type`, `None`

**2. Numeric Types**
- `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`

**3. Collection Types**
- `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`
- `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (collections)

**4. Datetime Types**

## 4. Installation

Pyon is released on PyPI. You can install it via:

```bash
pip install pyon-core
```

Alternatively, you can install directly from the source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eonflux-ai/pyon.git
```

---
<br>

## 5. Quick Start

Below are some quick examples to help you get started.

### Basic Serialization and Deserialization

```python
import pyon

# 1. Python Data: Classes, Collections, Dataframes, Numpy arrays, etc...
data = {...}

# 2. One line Encode and Decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)

# 3. One line Encode and Decode to and from File...
pyon.to_file(data, "data.pyon")
decoded = pyon.from_file("data.pyon")
```

---
<br>

## 6. Examples

Pyon provides several usage examples covering supported data types and common serialization scenarios.
These examples are located in the `examples/` directory and provide practical use cases for serialization and deserialization.

Check **[EXAMPLES.md](examples/EXAMPLES.md)** for more information.

---
<br>

## 7. Recursion in Encoding and Decoding

Pyon supports recursive and nested data structures, such as dictionaries containing lists of sets, or custom objects nested within other containers. It is capable of encoding and decoding these compositions while preserving the original structure and supported types.

```python
import pyon

# 1. Test Objects...
example_data = {

    # 1.1 Tuple, Set...
    "tuple-set": ({"abc", "def"}),

    # 1.2 List, Tuple, Set...
    "list-tuple-set": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})],

    # 1.3 Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]
    },

    # 1.4 Dict, Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "one": {"a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]},
        "two": {"b": [({"ghi", "jkl"}), ({3.0, 4.0}), ({True, False})]}
    }

}

# 2. One Line encode and decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(example_data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)
```

This capability allows Pyon to represent arbitrarily nested structures without flattening or discarding information, as long as the types involved are supported by the library.

Check **[EXAMPLES.md](examples/EXAMPLES.md)** for more information.

<br>

## 8. Decode Without Execution

Pyon was designed with **security and predictability** as core principles during deserialization.

When decoding a `.pyon` file, Pyon **does not execute any user-defined code**.

The `decode()` function strictly reconstructs object structures by assigning values to their attributes.\
No methods are called, no constructors are run, and no business logic is triggered during the process.

This behavior ensures that deserialization remains fully **passive and deterministic**, regardless of the object‚Äôs type.\
This design favors transparency and reduces side effects during object reconstruction.

### üîí What Happens During Decoding

- Only object attributes are restored ‚Äî methods are not invoked.
- No constructors (`__init__`) are called.
- No evaluation or arbitrary code interpretation occurs.
- No custom logic is executed.
- **Reflection** is used to locate and instantiate Python types based on module and class names.
- Type reconstruction is driven entirely by static text fields embedded in the `.pyon` file.
- Even for custom classes, only the internal structure is rebuilt.

---
<br>

## 9. JSON Compatibility

Pyon is built entirely on top of the JSON standard ‚Äî it **generates**, **loads**, and **stores** valid JSON data.

Pyon extends JSON by adding an internal logic layer that **preserves type information**. This allows Pyon to **reconstruct complex Python objects**, including types that JSON alone cannot represent, such as `set`, `tuple`, `complex`, `datetime`, or custom classes.

### üîÅ Encoding Process

During encoding, Pyon performs two key steps:

1. It converts the original Python object into a **JSON-compatible dictionary** that includes both the data and additional text fields indicating the original types.
2. This dictionary is then serialized into a standard JSON string and optionally saved to a file.

The output is a fully valid JSON document ‚Äî readable and parseable by any standard JSON parser ‚Äî but structured in a way that allows Pyon to restore Python-specific semantics.

### üîÑ Decoding Process

During decoding, Pyon follows the reverse logic:

1. It loads the JSON string and parses it into a plain dictionary.
2. It then interprets the additional textual fields to **rebuild the original Python objects** and restore their intended types.

This process is entirely passive and does not invoke any user-defined logic or methods.

### üß© JSON-Compatible but Python-Aware

Pyon can be thought of as a **lossless extension of JSON for Python** ‚Äî enabling round-trip serialization of supported types.

Data saved with Pyon remains readable, transferable, and inspectable across environments, while preserving the ability to recover supported Python types securely.

### **Key Highlights**

1. **Public Interface**:

   - The `api.py` file provides a high-level interface for users, exposing key methods like `encode`, `decode`, `to_file`, and `from_file` for seamless serialization and deserialization.

   - The `encoder.py` file in the root directory serves as the public interface for encoding/decoding logic, while the internal logic is delegated to submodules in `encoders/`.

2. **Encoders Modularization**:

   - The `encoders/` directory contains submodules for handling specific types of data (e.g., basic types, collections, numeric types).
   - This improves scalability and separates the encoding logic from the main `encoder.py` file.

3. **Testing Structure**:

   - The `tests/` directory mirrors the project‚Äôs modular structure, with subtests for each encoder submodule.

This structure ensures clarity, scalability, and ease of maintenance as the project evolves. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contribute!

<br>

## 11. Encoders

The **encoders** in Pyon are modularized to handle different data types efficiently. The main `encoder.py` file serves as the public interface for encoding and decoding, while the internal logic is organized into submodules within the `encoders/` directory.

Each submodule is responsible for specific categories of data types, ensuring maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the encoders and the types they manage:


| **Encoder**         | **Types**                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base_types`        | `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `type`, `None`                                           |
| `numeric_types`     | `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`                                                            |
| `collection_types`  | `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`                               |
|                     | `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (from collections)          |
| `datetime_types`    | `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`                                   |
| `mapping_types`     | `class` (user defined classes), `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dict`, `Enum`                 |
| `specialized_types` | `bitarray.bitarray`, `numpy.ndarray`, `pyon.File`, `uuid.UUID`                          |
|                     | `pandas.DataFrame`, `pandas.Series`                                                     |


This modularization simplifies the process of adding support for new data types and ensures that each encoder submodule focuses solely on its designated category of data.

As the building blocks for other types, the base types don't require encoding and decoding.

---
<br>

## 12. Testing

Pyon uses **pytest** for automated testing. The test suite covers:

- Serialization and deserialization for all supported types.  
- Validation of valid, invalid, and null inputs.  
- Logging of errors with `caplog` and temporary file handling with `tmp_path`.

To run the tests locally:

```bash
cd Pyon
pytest
```

## 13. Roadmap

For detailed plans, phased expansions, and future directions, see the [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) file.

---
<br>

## 14. MIME Type

Pyon files use a structured JSON-compatible format and are best identified by the MIME type:  
`application/vnd.pyon+json`

This follows the IANA convention for custom JSON-based types (`+json`) and is appropriate for files with `.pyon` extension.

This media type has been submitted for registration with IANA and may appear in the official registry in future versions.
