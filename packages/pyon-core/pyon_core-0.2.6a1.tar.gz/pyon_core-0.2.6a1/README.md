## 1. Overview

Pyon is a Python library that extends the JSON format to support a broader set of Python-native data types, including sets, tuples, enums, user-defined classes, and structures from libraries such as NumPy and pandas.

It provides a serialization and deserialization mechanism that preserves the structure and type information of supported objects using additional metadata embedded in standard JSON.

Pyon was designed with the following principles:

- **JSON-valid output**: All serialized data is valid JSON and can be parsed back by a Pyon decoder.
- **Type preservation**: Encoded objects retain enough metadata to be accurately reconstructed as their original Python types.
- **Modular architecture**: Support for data types is implemented through independent encoders, allowing structured maintenance and future expansion.

Pyon is suitable for tasks such as storing structured data, saving configurations, exporting Python objects for inspection or reuse, and ensuring deterministic reconstruction across environments ‚Äî provided that all involved types are supported.

---
<br>

## 2. Simplified Interface

Pyon provides a straightforward interface with four main methods:

- **`encode(obj)`**: Serializes a Python object into a Pyon string.
- **`decode(data)`**: Deserializes a Pyon string into the corresponding Python object.
- **`to_file(obj, file_path)`**: Serializes a Python object and saves the result to a file.
- **`from_file(file_path)`**: Loads data from a file and deserializes it into the corresponding Python object.

Each of these methods automatically detects the data type and applies the appropriate serialization or deserialization logic.
<br>

### Additional options
Additional options are available in the core encoding methods:

| Method         | Description                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `encode(...)`  | Serializes an object to a Pyon string                 |
| `to_file(...)` | Saves a serialized object to disk                     |

These methods accept two optional parameters:

- `enc_protected=True` includes attributes starting with `_` in the serialization.
- `enc_private=True` includes name-mangled attributes starting with `__` in the serialization.

---
<br>

## 3. Supported Types

<br>

## 4. Installation

Pyon is released on PyPI. You can install it via:

```bash
pip install pyon-core
```

Alternatively, you can install directly from the source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/eonflux-ai/pyon.git
```

---
<br>

## 5. Quick Start

Below are some quick examples to help you get started.

### Basic Serialization and Deserialization

```python
import pyon

# 1. Python Data: Classes, Collections, Dataframes, Numpy arrays, etc...
data = {...}

# 2. One line Encode and Decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)

# 3. One line Encode and Decode to and from File...
pyon.to_file(data, "data.pyon")
decoded = pyon.from_file("data.pyon")
```

---
<br>

## 6. Examples

Pyon provides several usage examples covering supported data types and common serialization scenarios.
These examples are located in the `examples/` directory and provide practical use cases for serialization and deserialization.

Check **[EXAMPLES.md](examples/EXAMPLES.md)** for more information.

---
<br>

## 7. Recursion in Encoding and Decoding

Pyon supports recursive and nested data structures, such as dictionaries containing lists of sets, or custom objects nested within other containers. It is capable of encoding and decoding these compositions while preserving the original structure and supported types.

```python
import pyon

# 1. Test Objects...
example_data = {

    # 1.1 Tuple, Set...
    "tuple-set": ({"abc", "def"}),

    # 1.2 List, Tuple, Set...
    "list-tuple-set": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})],

    # 1.3 Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]
    },

    # 1.4 Dict, Dict, List, Tuple, Set...
    "dict-dict-list-tuple-set": {
        "one": {"a": [({"abc", "def"}), ({1, 2}), ({True, False})]},
        "two": {"b": [({"ghi", "jkl"}), ({3.0, 4.0}), ({True, False})]}
    }

}

# 2. One Line encode and decode...
encoded = pyon.encode(example_data)
decoded = pyon.decode(encoded)
```

This capability allows Pyon to represent arbitrarily nested structures without flattening or discarding information, as long as the types involved are supported by the library.

Check **[EXAMPLES.md](examples/EXAMPLES.md)** for more information.

---
<br>

## 8. Decode Behavior and Safety Overview

Pyon was designed to ensure **safe and deterministic reconstruction** of Python objects from `.pyon` files.

The decoding process does **not execute any user-defined code**. No custom methods such as `__init__`, `__post_init__` are triggered.

Instead, object reconstruction follows this predictable flow:

- Type information is parsed from static metadata fields.
- Objects are instantiated using `__new__` or built-in constructors where necessary.
- Attributes are restored via direct assignment ‚Äî no custom logic is invoked.

This approach ensures that deserialization remains **passive, safe, and transparent** in trusted contexts.

---

### üîç Constructor Exceptions

Some supported types ‚Äî such as `decimal.Decimal`, `datetime`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `numpy.ndarray`, and `File` ‚Äî require calling their constructors during decoding.

In all such cases, constructors are used in a **controlled and deterministic way**, strictly for data restoration, without invoking arbitrary or user-defined logic.

However, a few types involve additional caveats:

- `defaultdict` may invoke its `default_factory`, which can contain logic.
- `namedtuple` subclasses may define methods or side effects.
- `Enum` can override `__new__`, introducing dynamic behavior.
- `File` content can be manipulated by third parties to inject unsafe payloads.

These types are handled within modules such as `collection_types.py` and `specialized_types.py`, which are documented as **having special decoding behavior**.

## 9. JSON Compatibility

Pyon uses standard **JSON syntax** for all its serialized output. The result is a `.pyon` file that can be parsed by any standard JSON parser in terms of structure ‚Äî but not necessarily understood in terms of semantics.

Although every `.pyon` file is a valid JSON document, it embeds additional metadata (e.g., `__type__`, `__module__`) that is **essential for reconstructing Python objects**. This makes Pyon a **superset of JSON**, not a drop-in replacement.

### üîÅ Encoding Process

When encoding, Pyon:

1. Converts Python objects into a **dictionary structure compatible with JSON syntax**.
2. Adds metadata fields that describe the object‚Äôs original type and context.
3. Serializes the resulting dictionary to a JSON string (or file).

The output is a syntactically valid JSON document that retains full information about Python-specific constructs, including:

- Complex types like `tuple`, `set`, `complex`, `datetime`, `Decimal`
- Nested and custom classes
- Type annotations for accurate reconstruction

### üîÑ Decoding Process

When decoding:

1. The `.pyon` file is first parsed using a standard JSON parser (e.g., `json.loads`).
2. Then, Pyon-specific metadata is interpreted to **reconstruct the original object structure and types**.

### üß© Compatibility Notes

While the file format conforms to JSON in syntax:

- Generic tools can parse the structure but **will not reconstruct the original Python types** without a Pyon-compatible decoder.
- Do **not** use `.pyon` files as substitutes for `application/json` in systems expecting generic JSON ‚Äî behavior may be incorrect or undefined.
- The Pyon format is most effective when both encoding and decoding are done using the Pyon library itself.

> ‚úÖ JSON-readable.  
> ‚ùå Not semantically interoperable without the Pyon specification.

### **Key Highlights**

1. **Public Interface**:

   - The `api.py` file provides a high-level interface for users, exposing key methods like `encode`, `decode`, `to_file`, and `from_file` for seamless serialization and deserialization.

   - The `encoder.py` file in the root directory serves as the public interface for encoding/decoding logic, while the internal logic is delegated to submodules in `encoders/`.

2. **Encoders Modularization**:

   - The `encoders/` directory contains submodules for handling specific types of data (e.g., basic types, collections, numeric types).
   - This improves scalability and separates the encoding logic from the main `encoder.py` file.

3. **Testing Structure**:

   - The `tests/` directory mirrors the project‚Äôs modular structure, with subtests for each encoder submodule.

This structure ensures clarity, scalability, and ease of maintenance as the project evolves. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contribute!

<br>

## 11. Encoders

The **encoders** in Pyon are modularized to handle different data types efficiently. The main `encoder.py` file serves as the public interface for encoding and decoding, while the internal logic is organized into submodules within the `encoders/` directory.

Each submodule is responsible for specific categories of data types, ensuring maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the encoders and the types they manage:


| **Encoder**         | **Types**                                                                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base_types`        | `bool`, `float`, `int`, `str`, `type`, `None`                                           |
| `numeric_types`     | `complex`, `decimal.Decimal`                                                            |
| `collection_types`  | `bytearray`, `bytes`, `frozenset`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`                               |
|                     | `ChainMap`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque`, `namedtuple` (from collections)          |
| `datetime_types`    | `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.time`                                   |
| `mapping_types`     | `class` (user defined classes), `dataclasses.dataclass`, `dict`, `Enum`                 |
| `specialized_types` | `bitarray.bitarray`, `numpy.ndarray`, `pyon.File`, `uuid.UUID`                          |
|                     | `pandas.DataFrame`, `pandas.Series`                                                     |


This modularization simplifies the process of adding support for new data types and ensures that each encoder submodule focuses solely on its designated category of data.

As the building blocks for other types, the base types don't require encoding and decoding.

<br>

## 12. Testing

Pyon uses **pytest** for automated testing. The test suite covers:

- Serialization and deserialization for all supported types.  
- Validation of valid, invalid, and null inputs.  
- Logging of errors with `caplog` and temporary file handling with `tmp_path`.

To run the tests locally:

```bash
cd Pyon
pytest
```

For detailed plans, phased expansions, and future directions, see the [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) file.

---
<br>

## 14. MIME Type

Pyon files use a structured JSON-compatible format and are best identified by the MIME type:  
`application/vnd.pyon+json`

This follows the IANA convention for custom JSON-based types (`+json`) and is appropriate for files with `.pyon` extension.

This media type is officially registered with IANA and listed in the official registry:
