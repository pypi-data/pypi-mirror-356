# Checking results

## Checking results

An overview can be generated by using the CLI
```bash
hex report experiments
```
Which will list the experiments with their input parameters and indicate their status. 
Note here `experiments` is refering to the directory we specified.

One might every so often want to not just compute something, but also look at the 
results of those computations. shephex provides ways of retrieving these through 
a number of convenience functions 

- `shephex.id_where`: To retrieve identifiers 
- `shephex.results_where`: To retrieve the output of the function. 
- `shephex.path_where`: To retrieve paths. This is especially useful if it is not the output of the function but something that was created and saved by the function that is of interest. 

They all share the same syntax.
