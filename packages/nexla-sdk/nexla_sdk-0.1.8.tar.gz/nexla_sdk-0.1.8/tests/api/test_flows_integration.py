"""
Integration tests for the Flows API

These tests validate the full lifecycle of a flow:
1. Create a flow
2. Get the flow
3. Update the flow
4. List flows and verify our flow is included
5. Add/remove tags to the flow
6. Delete the flow

These tests also validate the basic operations on flows:
1. List flows
2. Get flow details
3. Get flows by resource (source, sink, dataset)
4. Activate and pause flows
