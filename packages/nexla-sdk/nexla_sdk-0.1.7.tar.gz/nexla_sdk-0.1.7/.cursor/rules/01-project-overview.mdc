# Nexla SDK Project Overview

The Nexla SDK is a Python client library for interacting with the Nexla API, a platform for data operations and integration.

## Key Components

The SDK is structured around these core components:

1. **Client**: [nexla_sdk/client.py](mdc:nexla_sdk/client.py) contains the main `NexlaClient` class which initializes all API endpoints and handles authentication.

2. **API Resources**: Each Nexla resource has its own API class in the [nexla_sdk/api/](mdc:nexla_sdk/api) directory, inheriting from [BaseAPI](mdc:nexla_sdk/api/base.py).

3. **Models**: Type-safe Pydantic models in [nexla_sdk/models/](mdc:nexla_sdk/models) represent API responses with proper typing.

4. **Exceptions**: Custom exception classes in [nexla_sdk/exceptions.py](mdc:nexla_sdk/exceptions.py) provide specific error handling.

## API Organization

The client exposes various resources as properties:

```python
client = NexlaClient(service_key="your-nexla-service-key")

# Access different API resources
client.flows        # Flow management
client.sources      # Data sources
client.destinations # Data destinations 
client.nexsets      # Data sets
client.credentials  # Credentials management
client.transforms   # Data transformations
client.webhooks     # Webhook integrations
client.organizations # Organization management
client.users        # User management
client.teams        # Team management
client.projects     # Project management
```

Each resource provides methods following a consistent pattern for CRUD operations and resource-specific actions.

## Key Areas

1. **API Modules** - Located in [nexla_sdk/api](mdc:nexla_sdk/api/__init__.py) directory
2. **Data Models** - Located in [nexla_sdk/models](mdc:nexla_sdk/models/__init__.py) directory
3. **Examples** - Located in [examples/basic_usage.py](mdc:examples/basic_usage.py)

## Getting Started

The best way to understand this SDK is to look at the examples and refer to the README for basic usage patterns.
