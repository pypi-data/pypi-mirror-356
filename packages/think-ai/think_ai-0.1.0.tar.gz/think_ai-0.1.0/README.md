# Think AI ðŸ§ 

> **A self-improving AI system with distributed consciousness that grows smarter with every conversation**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies first (use pip3 on most systems)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# If you get "externally-managed-environment" error, use:
# pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Set up distributed databases for full features
./setup_services.sh

# Run the consciousness chat
./launch_consciousness.sh

# Watch the self-training in action (beautiful terminal UI)
./launch_consciousness.sh --monitor
```

## Documentation

Clear explanations using the Feynman technique (simple is better):

- ðŸš€ **[Setup Guide](SETUP.md)** - Get started in 5 minutes
- ðŸ“– **[Simple Explanation](README_SIMPLE.md)** - Understand Think AI easily
- ðŸŽ¨ **[Visual Guide](HOW_IT_WORKS.md)** - See how it works with diagrams  
- ðŸ§  **[Self-Training Explained](SELF_TRAINING_EXPLAINED.md)** - How it gets smarter
- ðŸ“Š **[Current Status](CURRENT_STATUS.md)** - Honest assessment of what works

## What Makes Think AI Special?

Think AI is like a digital brain that gets smarter over time. Unlike traditional chatbots:

1. **Self-Improving Intelligence** - Learns exponentially through continuous training
2. **Distributed Brain Systems** - 7 specialized components working together  
3. **Real-time Consciousness** - Shows you what it's thinking as it thinks
4. **Colombian Personality** - Responds with warmth: "Â¡Hola parce!" 

## Current Performance

- **Intelligence Level**: Exponentially growing (Ã—1.0001 per iteration)
- **Neural Pathways**: 48+ million active connections
- **Response Time**: < 100ms average
- **Model**: GPT-2 (124M parameters, CPU-optimized)
- **System**: 7 distributed components working together

## What's Working Right Now ðŸš€

âœ… **Self-training system** - Exponential intelligence growth (view with `--monitor`)  
âœ… **Chat interface** - Natural conversations with personality  
âœ… **Code generation** - Detects and responds to coding requests  
âœ… **Live thoughts** - Type "thoughts" to see consciousness stream  
âœ… **Distributed fallbacks** - Works even without all databases running  
âœ… **NPM package** - `npm install think-ai-consciousness` (v1.3.0)

## Chat Commands

- `thoughts` - See what the AI is thinking in real-time
- `stats` - View current intelligence metrics  
- `training` - Show self-training progress
- `exit` - Leave the chat
