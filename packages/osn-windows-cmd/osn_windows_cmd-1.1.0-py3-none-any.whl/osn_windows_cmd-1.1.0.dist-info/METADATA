# osn-windows-cmd: Simplify Windows Command-Line Interactions

osn-windows-cmd is a Python library designed to streamline working with common Windows command-line tools. It provides convenient functions and parameter handling for commands like `netstat`, `shutdown`, and `taskkill`, abstracting away the complexities of constructing and executing these commands directly.


## Key Features

*   **Simplified Command Execution:** Construct and execute Windows commands with intuitive function calls and parameter management.
*   **Structured Output Parsing:** Process the output of commands like `netstat` into easy-to-use Pandas DataFrames.
*   **Cross-Compatibility:** Designed to work seamlessly across various Windows versions.
*   **Clear Documentation and Examples:** Well-documented code and usage examples to get you started quickly.


## Installation

* **With pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install osn-windows-cmd
    ```

* **With git:**
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/oddshellnick/osn-windows-cmd.git
    ```


## Current Functionality

*   **netstat:** Retrieve system network statistics, including active connections, routing tables, and interface information. Parse the returned data directly into Pandas DataFrames. Conveniently find free ports on localhost.
*   **shutdown:** Initiate shutdowns and restarts of local or remote Windows systems with various options (forceful shutdown, reason logging, timeout period, etc.).
*   **taskkill:** Terminate processes based on various criteria such as image name or process ID.


## Usage Examples

**taskkill:**

```python
from osn_windows_cmd.taskkill.parameters import ImageName
from osn_windows_cmd.taskkill import taskkill_windows
# Forcefully kill all notepad.exe processes
taskkill_windows("/F", selectors=ImageName("notepad.exe"))
```

**netstat:**

```python
from osn_windows_cmd.netstat import get_netstat_connections_data
# Get all active TCP connections
connections = get_netstat_connections_data(protocol="TCP")
```

**shutdown:**

```python
from osn_windows_cmd.shutdown.parameters import ShutdownReason, ShutdownReasonType, ShutdownType
from osn_windows_cmd.shutdown import shutdown_windows
# Restart the local machine after 60 seconds, logging the reason
shutdown_windows(ShutdownType.restart, time_out_period=60,
                 shutdown_reason=ShutdownReason(ShutdownReasonType.planned, 4, 2))
```


More comprehensive usage examples and detailed documentation can be found within the project's source code docstrings.


## Future Notes

osn-windows-cmd is an ongoing project and will be expanded to support more Windows commands in the future. We welcome contributions from the community. Feel free to suggest new commands to be added or submit pull requests with your own implementations.
