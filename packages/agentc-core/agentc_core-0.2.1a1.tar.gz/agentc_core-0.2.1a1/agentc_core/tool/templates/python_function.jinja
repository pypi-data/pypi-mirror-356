# Although Python uses duck-typing, the specification of models greatly improves the response quality of LLMs.
# It is highly recommended that all tools specify the models of their bound functions using Pydantic or dataclasses.

#     sales_formula: str


# Only functions decorated with "tool" will be indexed.
