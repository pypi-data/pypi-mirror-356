"""ASDCache is a module to retrieve data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database that uses caching for fast local access.

To make the most use out of the cache, `ASDCache` is opinionated in the information it retrieves from the ASD; it always requests the same schema of information and locally computes additional fields.

The `SpectraCache` class acts as the entrypoint to retrieve this data.
