A Python library providing a unified interface for integrating various Nepali payment gateways and digital wallets into your Python applications.

## Overview

Integrating multiple payment gateways can be complex due to differing APIs, authentication mechanisms, and response formats. `nepal-gateways` aims to simplify this by offering:

*   A consistent API structure for common operations like payment initiation and verification across different gateways.
*   Clear error handling with custom exceptions.
*   Type-hinted and well-documented code.

## Supported Gateways

Currently, the following gateways are supported:

*   **eSewa (ePay v2 - with HMAC Signature)**
*   *Khalti (Coming Soon)*
*   *(Other gateways will be added based on demand and API availability)*

## Installation

You can install `nepal-gateways` using pip:

```bash
pip install nepal-gateways
```

The library requires the `requests` package for making HTTP calls, which will be installed automatically as a dependency.

## Quick Start - eSewa Example

Here's a brief example of how to use the `EsewaClient`. For full details, please see the [eSewa Client Documentation](./docs/EsewaClient.md).

**1. Configuration & Initialization:**

```python
from nepal_gateways import EsewaClient, ConfigurationError
from typing import Union # For Amount type alias if used in example

# Define type alias for clarity
Amount = Union[int, float]
OrderID = str

# For Sandbox/UAT
esewa_sandbox_config = {
    "product_code": "EPAYTEST",  # Your sandbox merchant code from eSewa
    "secret_key": "8gBm/:&EnhH.1/q", # eSewa's official UAT secret key
    "success_url": "https://yourdomain.com/payment/esewa/success",
    "failure_url": "https://yourdomain.com/payment/esewa/failure",
    "mode": "sandbox"
}

try:
    client = EsewaClient(config=esewa_sandbox_config)
except ConfigurationError as e:
    print(f"Configuration Error: {e}")
    # Handle error
```

**2. Initiating a Payment:**

```python
from nepal_gateways import InitiationError

merchant_order_id: OrderID = "MYORDER-001"
payment_amount: Amount = 100 # Total amount for the order

try:
    # For eSewa, 'amount' is the base, other charges are separate parameters
    # Total amount for signature will be amount + tax_amount + product_service_charge + product_delivery_charge
    init_response = client.initiate_payment(
        amount=payment_amount, # Base amount
        order_id=merchant_order_id,
        tax_amount=0,           # Example: 0 tax
        product_service_charge=0, # Example: 0 service charge
        product_delivery_charge=0 # Example: 0 delivery charge
    )

    if init_response.is_redirect_required:
        print(f"Redirect User to: {init_response.redirect_url}")
        print(f"With Method: {init_response.redirect_method}") # Should be POST
        print(f"And Form Fields: {init_response.form_fields}")
        # In a web app, render an HTML form that auto-submits these fields.
except InitiationError as e:
    print(f"Initiation Failed: {e}")
```

**3. Verifying a Payment (in your callback handler):**

eSewa will redirect the user to your `success_url` or `failure_url` with a `data` query parameter containing a Base64 encoded JSON string.

```python
from nepal_gateways import VerificationError, InvalidSignatureError

# Example: In a Flask route handling the callback
# @app.route('/payment/esewa/success', methods=['GET'])
# def esewa_callback_handler():
#     request_data = request.args.to_dict() # e.g., {"data": "BASE64_STRING_FROM_ESEWA"}

# For this standalone example, let's assume request_data is populated:
# Replace with actual data from a test transaction
# This is what your web framework's request object would give you
# For a GET callback: request_data = {"data": "ACTUAL_BASE64_ENCODED_STRING_FROM_ESEWA_CALLBACK"}
# For a POST callback (if eSewa POSTs JSON): request_data = ACTUAL_PARSED_JSON_OBJECT_FROM_ESEWA

# Placeholder for example - replace with real callback data for testing
request_data_from_esewa_callback = {"data": "GET_THIS_FROM_A_REAL_SANDBOX_TRANSACTION_CALLBACK"}

try:
    verification = client.verify_payment(
        transaction_data_from_callback=request_data_from_esewa_callback
    )

    if verification.is_successful:
        print(f"Payment Verified for Order ID: {verification.order_id}, eSewa Txn ID: {verification.transaction_id}")
        # Update your database, fulfill order
    else:
        print(f"Payment Not Verified or Failed for Order ID: {verification.order_id}. Status: {verification.status_code}")
        # Check verification.status_message and verification.raw_response for details

except InvalidSignatureError:
    print("CRITICAL: Callback signature is invalid! Do not trust this transaction.")
except VerificationError as e:
    print(f"Verification process error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error during verification: {e}")
```

For more detailed information on using the `EsewaClient`, including all configuration options and error handling, please refer to the [eSewa Client Documentation](./docs/EsewaClient.md).

## Logging

This library uses Python's standard `logging` module. All loggers within this package are children of the `nepal_gateways` logger.

To enable logging (e.g., for debugging), configure the `nepal_gateways` logger in your application:

```python
import logging

# Simplest configuration to see debug messages on console
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Or, more specific configuration:
logger = logging.getLogger('nepal_gateways')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
# Add your desired handlers
# stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
# logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
```
The library itself does not add any handlers by default (except a `NullHandler` to prevent "No handler found" warnings if the application has not configured logging).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add support for a new gateway, improve existing ones, or fix bugs, please feel free to:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3.  Write tests for your changes.
4.  Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to basic linting standards (e.g., `ruff`, `black`) and that all tests pass.

*(More details can be added to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file later.)*
