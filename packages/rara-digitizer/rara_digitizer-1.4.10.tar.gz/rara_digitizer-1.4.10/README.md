### Caching

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

Multiple components and tools load files from the disk into memory and initialize them into
Python objects, which usually would bring with it a certain amount of overhead during larger workflows.

To prevent that, a mechanism was created to handle (download, initialize etc) the management of such resources
and caching them into memory to be shared amongst the necessary parts of the code that need it. When creating a factory,
the process of loading the components into memory is already included internally and no further action on the user is
necessary.

However, when using handlers and other components as stand-alone, the user needs to initialize and pass an instance
of the `ResourceManager` class.

#### Caching through FileHandlerFactory

```python
from rara_digitizer.factory.file_handler_factory import FileHandlerFactory

### BAD
# This creates two factories, with each their separate caches.
with FileHandlerFactory().get_handler(file_or_folder_path="rara_review.pdf") as handler:
    handler.extract_all_data()

with FileHandlerFactory().get_handler(file_or_folder_path="rara_manual.docx") as manager:
    manager.extract_all_data()

### GOOD
# This creates a ResourceManager (the cache mechanism) inside the factory and sends
# it to every handler it returns to the user.
factory = FileHandlerFactory()

with factory.get_handler(file_or_folder_path="rara_review.pdf") as handler:
    handler.extract_all_data()

with factory.get_handler(file_or_folder_path="rara_manual.docx") as manager:
    manager.extract_all_data()
```

### Initializing the cache manually

```python
from rara_digitizer.factory.resource_manager import ResourceManager
from rara_digitizer.tools.image_classification import ImageClassificator
from rara_digitizer.tools.text_postproc import TextPostprocessor

resource_manager = ResourceManager()
classifier = ImageClassificator(resource_manager)
text_posprocessor = TextPostprocessor(resource_manager)
```

### Limited model initialization

By default, the `ResourceManager` will download every single model necessary for this application
automatically on initialization, however that process can be turned off entirely or changed depending on the need.

```python

from rara_digitizer.factory.resource_manager import ResourceManager
from rara_digitizer.factory.file_handler_factory import FileHandlerFactory

# Disabling automatic download.
resource_manager = ResourceManager(autodownload_true=False)
factory = FileHandlerFactory(resource_manager=resource_manager)
resource_manager.initialize_resources()  # Starts the download process.

# Limiting the resources to download.
# Paths needs to be dot notated to the source of the class that implements the Resource base class.
class_paths = ["rara_digitizer.factory.resources.yolo.YOLOImageDetector"]
resource_manager = ResourceManager(resources=class_paths)
factory = FileHandlerFactory(resource_manager=resource_manager)
```

### Custom resources

In case the user wants to use a custom resource, they need create a class that implements the `Resource` interface.
Class variables other than `unique_key` can be left empty, what matters is the implementation of the methods.
`ResourceManager` will first run the `download_resource` method and then the `initialize_resource` method.

```python
import pathlib
from rara_digitizer.factory.resource_manager import ResourceManager, DEFAULT_RESOURCES
from rara_digitizer.factory.resources.base import Resource


class Huggingface(Resource):
    unique_key = "huggingface"
    resource_uri = "..."
    location_dir = "..."
    models = ["..."]
    default_model = "..."

    def __init__(self, base_directory: str, **kwargs):
        self.base_directory = pathlib.Path(base_directory)

    def download_resource(self):
        ...

    def initialize_resource(self):
        ...

    def get_resource(self, **kwargs):
        ...


huggingface_resource = Huggingface(base_directory="./models")
resource_manager = ResourceManager(resources=[*DEFAULT_RESOURCES, huggingface_resource])
resource_manager = ResourceManager(resources=[*DEFAULT_RESOURCES, "path.to.Huggingface"])

# To access the resource, the get_resource method most be implemented and called through
# the ResourceManager class through the unique_key of the resource.
model = resource_manager.get_resource("huggingface")
```

### Using Custom Models

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

Replace the default models with custom ones by setting the corresponding environment variables to the desired model
files.
Code and documentation for retraining the ViT image classifier and Tesseract OCR models can be found at

- [the rara-image-classification repository](https://gitlab.com/e1544/kratt-kata24/rara-image-classification), and
- [the rara-ocr-finetuning repository](https://gitlab.com/e1544/kratt-kata24/rara-ocr-finetuning)

</details>

### Examples

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

It is possible to extract all possible data from various filetypes by feeding the file into `FileHandlerFactory`.
A sample code snippet using the `FileHandlerFactory` and running the `extract_all_data()` method would look like this:

```python
from rara_digitizer.factory.file_handler_factory import FileHandlerFactory

file_path = "kevade.epub"

# The Context Manager ensures that any temporary files are deleted after use
with FileHandlerFactory().get_handler(file_or_folder_path=file_path) as handler:
    output = handler.extract_all_data()
```

The example output could then look like this:

```json

## üèóÔ∏è Digitizer's Logical Structure

Overview of the `rara-digitizer` component's logical structure.

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

The component's input is a document, which is passed to the `FileHandlerFactory` class. The class's task is to
find a suitable `Handler` class for the document based on its file type.
The handlers support various file formats (e.g., DOCXHandler for DOCX files, PDFHandler for PDF files, etc.),
as shown on the diagram.

![Digitizer Component Diagram](https://packages.texta.ee/texta-resources/rara_models/digitizer_diagram.png)

Each file type has its own implementation for various extraction methods, with each one focusing
on different content, such as text, images, or document-related metadata.

All of these methods can be run independently, but most of the time, it is necessary to collect all the data
at once. For this purpose, the `BaseHandler` class has an `extract_all_data()` method that combines the results
of different methods into a single standardized output. This function collects the following data:

- The document's longest physical measurement (e.g., height or width),
- Number of pages (including an indication of whether the count is estimated based on word count),
    - The estimation is necessary for file types like TXT, DOC(X), EPUB, where the number of pages is not physically
      defined,
- Language distribution, including the segment count and ratio of each language,
- Average text quality [0-1], including the original ALTO text quality and OCR application status,
    - It is important to note that ALTO quality is not used in OCR need assessment, as it does not exist for all file
      types,
      and therefore the text quality assessment is always done by the text quality model.
- Word and character count,
- Metadata specific to the file type, such as EPUB or METS/ALTO metadata,
- Texts, each with additional information such as page numbers, language, text quality, and word/character count, and
  other metadata
- Images, each with classification and page number.
