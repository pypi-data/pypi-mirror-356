    .. note::
       This algorithm seeks to find an inconsistency score for metabolites based
       on gene expression. The gene expression is represented by reaction weights,
       which can be calculated by combining
       :func:`metworkpy.utils.expression_utils.expr_to_metchange_gene_weights` and
       :func:`metworkpy.gpr.gpr_functions.gene_to_rxn_weights`. The algorithm calculates the
       inconsistency score through a two part optimization. First, for a given
       metabolite, the maximum metabolite production is found. Then the metabolite
       production is constrained to stay within objective_tolerance*maximum-production of
       the maximum metabolite production, and the inner product of reaction weights,
       and reaction fluxes is minimized.
       This minimum inner product is the inconsistency score.
