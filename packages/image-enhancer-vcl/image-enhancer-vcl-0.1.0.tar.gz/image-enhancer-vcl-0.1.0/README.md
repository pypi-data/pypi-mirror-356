#image-enhancer-vc


A deep learningâ€“based image enhancement library built using **Real-ESRGAN** for super-resolution and **GFPGAN** for face restoration. 
It also performs image validation and blurriness detection before enhancement.

## Features

-  Super-resolution with Real-ESRGAN
-  Face enhancement with GFPGAN
-  Blurriness detection using Laplacian variance
-  Image validation (file format and integrity)
-  Saves enhanced output automatically

## Installation

'''bash
pip install image-enhancer-vc
