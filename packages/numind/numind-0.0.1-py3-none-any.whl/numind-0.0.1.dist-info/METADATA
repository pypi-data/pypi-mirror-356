              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# NuExtract SDK

Python SDK to interact with NuMind's [**NuExtract**](https://nuextract.ai) API.

## Installation

```sh
pip install numind
```

## Usage and code examples

### Create a client

You must first get an API key on [NuExtract](https://nuextract.ai).

```python
import os

from numind import NuMind

# Create a client object to interact with the API
# Providing the `api_key` is not required if the `NUMIND_API_KEY` environment variable
# is already set.
client = NuMind(api_key=os.environ["NUMIND_API_KEY"])
```

### Extract structured information "on the fly"

If you want to extract structured information from data without projects but just by providing the input template, you can use the `infer` method which provides a more user-friendly way to interact with the API:

```python
template = {
    "destination": {
        "name": "verbatim-string",
        "zip_code": "string",
        "country": "string"
    },
    "accommodation": "verbatim-string",
    "activities": ["verbatim-string"],
    "duration": {
        "time_unit": ["day", "week", "month", "year"],
        "time_quantity": "integer"
    }
}
input_text = """My dream vacation would be a month-long escape to the stunning islands of Tahiti.
I’d stay in an overwater bungalow in Bora Bora, waking up to crystal-clear turquoise waters and breathtaking sunrises.
Days would be spent snorkeling with vibrant marine life, paddleboarding over coral gardens, and basking on pristine white-sand beaches.
I’d explore lush rainforests, hidden waterfalls, and the rich Polynesian culture through traditional dance, music, and cuisine.
Evenings would be filled with romantic beachside dinners under the stars, with the soothing sound of waves as the perfect backdrop."""

output = client.extract(template=template, input_text=input_text)
print(output)

# Can also work with files, replace the path with your own
# from pathlib import Path
# output = client.extract(template=template, input_file=Path("to", "file.ppt"))
```

```json
{
    "destination": {
        "name": "Tahiti",
        "zip_code": "98730",
        "country": "France"
    },
    "accommodation": "overwater bungalow in Bora Bora",
    "activities": [
        "snorkeling",
        "paddleboarding",
        "basking",
        "explore lush rainforests, hidden waterfalls, and the rich Polynesian culture"
    ],
    "duration": {
        "time_unit": null,
        "time_quantity": null
    }
}
```

### Create a good template

NuExtract uses JSON schemas as extraction templates which specify the information to retrieve and their types, which are:

* **string**: a text, whose value can be abstract, i.e. totally free and can be deduced from calculations, reasoning, external knowledge;
* **verbatim-string**: a purely extractive text whose value must be present in the document. Some flexibility might be allowed on the formatting, e.g. new lines and escaped characters (e.g. `\n`) in a documents might be represented with a space;
* **integer**: an integer number;
* **number**: any number, that may be a floating point number or an integer;
* **boolean**: a boolean whose value should be either true or false;
* **date-time**: a date or time whose value should follow the ISO 8601 standard (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`). It may feature "reduced" accuracy, i.e. omitting certain date or time components not useful in specific cases. For examples, if the extracted value is a date, `YYYY-MM-DD` is a valid value format. The same applies to times with the `hh:mm:ss` format (without omitting the leading `T` symbol). Additionally, the "least significant" component might be omitted if it is not required or specified. For example, a specific month and year can be specified as `YYYY-MM` while omitting the day component `DD`. A specific hour can be specified as `hh` while omitting the minutes and seconds components. When combining dates and time, only the least significant time components can be omitted, e.g. `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm` which is omitting the seconds.

Additionally, the value of a field can be:

* a **nested dictionary**, i.e. another branch, describing elements associated to their parent node (key);
* an **array** of items of the form `["type"]`, whose values are elements of a given "type", which can also be a dictionary of unspecified depth;
* an **enum**, i.e. a list of elements to choose from of the form `["choice1", "choice2", ...]`. For values of this type, just set the value of the item to choose, e.g. "choice1", and do not set the value as an array containing the item such as `["choice1"]`;
* a **multi-enum**, i.e. a list from which multiple elements can be picked, of the form `[["choice1", "choice2", ...]]` (double square brackets).

#### Inferring a template

The "infer_template" method allows to quickly create a template that you can start to work with from a text description.

```python
from numind.openapi_client import TemplateRequest
from pydantic import StrictStr

description = "Create a template that extracts key information from an order confirmation email. The template should be able to pull details like the order ID, customer ID, date and time of the order, status, total amount, currency, item details (product ID, quantity, and unit price), shipping address, any customer requests or delivery preferences, and the estimated delivery date."
input_schema = client.post_api_infer_template(
    template_request=TemplateRequest(description=StrictStr(description))
)
```

### Create a project

A project allows to define an information extraction task from a template and examples.

```python
from numind.openapi_client import CreateProjectRequest

project_id = client.post_api_projects(
    CreateProjectRequest(
        name="vacation",
        description="Extraction of locations and activities",
        template=template,
    )
)
```

The `project_id` can also be found in the "API" tab of a project on the NuExtract website.

### Add examples to a project to teach NuExtract via ICL (In-Context Learning)

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Prepare examples, here a text and a file
example_1_input = "This is a text example"
example_1_expected_output = {
    "destination": {"name": None, "zip_code": None, "country": None}
}
with Path("path", "to", "example_2.odt").open("rb") as file:  # read bytes
    example_2_input = file.read()
example_2_expected_output = {
    "destination": {"name": None, "zip_code": None, "country": None}
}
examples = [
    (example_1_input, example_1_expected_output),
    (example_2_input, example_2_expected_output),
]

# Add the examples to the project
client.add_examples_to_project(project_id, examples)
```

### Extract structured information from text

```python
output_schema = client.extract(project_id, input_text=input_text)
```

### Extract structured information from a file

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("path", "to", "document.odt")
with file_path.open("rb") as file:
    input_file = file.read()
output_schema = client.extract(project_id, input_file=input_file)
```

# Documentation

### Extracting Information from Documents

Once your project is ready, you can use it to extract information from documents in real time via this RESTful API.

Each project has its own extraction endpoint:

`https://nuextract.ai/api/projects/{projectId}/extract`

You provide it a document and it returns the extracted information according to the task defined in the project. To use it, you need:

- To create an API key in the Account section
- To replace `{projectId}` by the project ID found in the API tab of the project

You can test your extraction endpoint in your terminal using this command-line example with curl (make sure that you replace values of `PROJECT_ID`, `NUEXTRACT_API_KEY`, and `FILE_NAME`):

```bash
NUEXTRACT_API_KEY=\"_your_api_key_here_\"; \\
PROJECT_ID=\"a24fd84a-44ab-4fd4-95a9-bebd46e4768b\"; \\
FILE_NAME=\"FrenchID.png\"; \\
curl \"https://nuextract.ai/api/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/extract\" \\
  -X POST \\
  -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${NUEXTRACT_API_KEY}\" \\
  -H \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\" \\
  -H \"x-file-name: ${FILE_NAME}\" \\
  --data-binary @\"${FILE_NAME}\"
```

You can also use the [Python SDK](https://github.com/numindai/nuextract-platform-sdk#documentation), by replacing the
`project_id`, `api_key` and `file_path` variables in the following code:

```python
from numind import NuMind
from pathlib import Path

client = NuMind(api_key=api_key)
file_path = Path(\"path\", \"to\", \"document.odt\")
with file_path.open(\"rb\") as file:
    input_file = file.read()
output_schema = client.post_api_projects_projectid_extract(project_id, input_file)
```

### Using the Platform via API

Everything you can do on the web platform can be done via API -
 check the [user guide](https://www.notion.so/User-Guide-17c16b1df8c580d3a579ebfb24ddbea7?pvs=21) to learn about how the platform works.
 This can be useful to create projects automatically, or to make your production more robust for example.

Main resources:

- **Project** - user project, identified by `projectId`
- **File** - uploaded file,  identified by `fileId`, stored up to two weeks if not tied to an Example
- **Document** - internal representation of a document, identified by `documentId`, created from a File or a text, stored up to two weeks if not tied to an Example
- **Example** - document-extraction pair given to teach NuExtract, identified by `exampleId`, created from a Document

Here are the main operations you might want to do via API:

- Creating a **Project** via `POST /api/projects`
- Changing the template of a **Project** via `PATCH /api/projects/{projectId}`
- Uploading a file to a **File** via `POST /api/files` (up to 2 weeks storage)
- Creating a **Document** via `POST /api/documents/text` and `POST /api/files/{fileID}/convert-to-document` from a text or a **File**
- Adding an **Example** to a **Project** via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/examples`
- Changing Project settings via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/settings`
- Locking a **Project** via `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/lock`

You can also use the [Python SDK](https://github.com/numindai/nuextract-platform-sdk#documentation).
