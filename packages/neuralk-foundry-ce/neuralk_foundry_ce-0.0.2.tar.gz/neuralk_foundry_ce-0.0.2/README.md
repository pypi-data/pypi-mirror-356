## 🎉 Welcome to Neuralk Foundry

**Neuralk Foundry** is a lightweight yet powerful framework for building modular machine learning pipelines — particularly well-suited for industrial tasks and representation learning. Whether you're prototyping or scaling up, Foundry helps you build, combine, and orchestrate steps cleanly and efficiently.

Foundry is also the engine behind [**TabBench**](https://github.com/Neuralk-AI/TabBench), Neuralk's internal benchmark for evaluating ML models on real-world tabular datasets.

### Why Foundry?

Most ML frameworks fall into one of two camps:

* **Rigid benchmarks and academic pipelines**: great for simple supervised learning tasks, but brittle or limited when adapting to more complex use cases.
* **Heavyweight MLOps frameworks** (e.g., ZenML, Metaflow): offer full orchestration but at the cost of steep setup and reduced flexibility.

**Foundry sits in between.** It gives you just the right level of structure to scale from prototype to production — without locking you into opinionated tooling.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

**Composable Workflows**
: Define steps in terms of their inputs and outputs — no black boxes.

**Supports Heterogeneous Tasks**
: Classification, regression, ranking, record linkage, and more.

**Customizable & Extensible**
: Plug in your own logic or replace any step with a variant.

**Built-in Caching & Logging**
: Avoid recomputation and keep track of metrics automatically.

**Workflow Explorer UI**
: Inspect and debug workflows through an interactive, visual interface.

**Reproducibility by Design**
: Strong separation between configuration, code, and data.

## 🧠 How Things Are Organized

Foundry is a modular framework. Its codebase is split into submodules that reflect each phase of the ML pipeline:

```
neuralk_foundry_ce/
├── datasets/               # Dataset loading utilities
├── sample_selection/
│   ├── splitter/           # Data splitting strategies (e.g., stratified shuffle)
│   └── blocking/           # Candidate pair selection (e.g., for deduplication)
├── feature_engineering/
│   ├── preprocessing/      # Traditional preprocessing for tabular data
│   ├── vectorizer/         # Text and other unstructured data vectorization
│   └── blocking/           # Pair processing modules for matching/merging
├── models/
│   ├── classifier/         # Classification models
│   ├── regressor/          # Regression models
│   ├── embedder/           # Embedding/representation learning
│   └── clustering/         # Clustering and unsupervised methods
├── workflow/               # Core execution engine: Step, Workflow, etc.
└── utils/                  # Helper functions and shared infrastructure
```

Each component (e.g., a model or preprocessing step) inherits from a base `Step` class and declares:

* Its expected **inputs**
* The **outputs** it produces
* Any configurable **parameters**

Steps can then be connected into a `Workflow`, either manually or through a task-specific template (e.g., `Classification`).

## ⚙️ Quick-Start Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install neuralk_foundry_ce
```

## 🔬 Development Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neuralk-AI/NeuralkFoundry-CE
cd NeuralkFoundry-CE
```

### Create a Dedicated Environment (recommended)

Neuralk Foundry relies on a variety of external machine learning libraries. As a result, managing package versions can be delicate. To avoid compatibility issues, we strongly recommend installing Foundry in a dedicated virtual environment (e.g., using conda or venv).

```bash
conda create -n foundry python=3.11
conda activate foundry
```

### Install the Package

```bash
pip install -e .
```
