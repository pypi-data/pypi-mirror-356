STRATEGY SELECTION ANALYSIS

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Complexity: {project_complexity}
- Team Size: {team_size} agents
- Timeline: {timeline}

AVAILABLE STRATEGIES:

üîÑ **Parallel Divergent** (2-6 agents)
- Best for: Complex problems, multiple valid approaches
- Process: Independent solutions ‚Üí peer review ‚Üí synthesis
- Time: Medium (parallel execution + review)

‚ö° **Pipeline** (3-4 agents)
- Best for: Sequential dependencies, specialization
- Process: Foundation ‚Üí Enhancement ‚Üí Refinement ‚Üí Validation
- Time: Medium (sequential but focused)

üêù **Swarm** (5-8 agents)
- Best for: Many independent tasks, speed priority
- Process: Task queue ‚Üí dynamic assignment ‚Üí emergence
- Time: Fast (maximum parallelism)

‚öîÔ∏è **Red Team** (4-6 agents)
- Best for: Security-critical, high-reliability systems
- Process: Build ‚Üí Break ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Harden ‚Üí Repeat
- Time: Slow (thorough validation)

üë• **Mob Programming** (3-5 agents)
- Best for: Complex problems, knowledge sharing
- Process: Collaborative coding with rotating roles
- Time: Medium (intensive collaboration)

RECOMMENDATION:
Based on the project context, recommend the optimal strategy and explain why.

    return f"""
AGENT: {agent_id}
BRANCH: {branch_name}
STRATEGY: Parallel Divergent ({total_agents} agents working independently)

MISSION:
{mission}

COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
1. **Read First**: Check `.agor/agentconvo.md` and `.agor/{agent_id.lower()}-memory.md`
2. **Communicate**: Post status updates to `.agor/agentconvo.md`
3. **Document**: Update `.agor/{agent_id.lower()}-memory.md` with decisions and progress
4. **Sync Often**: Pull from main branch frequently to stay current
5. **Stay Independent**: Work on YOUR solution approach without coordinating

EXECUTION RULES:
- Work INDEPENDENTLY - no coordination with other agents during development
- Focus on YOUR unique solution approach
- Document your design decisions in memory file
- Implement complete, working solution
- Commit frequently to your branch
- Prepare for peer review phase

COMMUNICATION FORMAT:
```
{agent_id}: [TIMESTAMP] - [STATUS/QUESTION/FINDING]
```

MEMORY FILE UPDATES:
- Current task and approach
- Key architectural decisions
- Files modified with descriptions
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Notes for peer review phase

DELIVERABLES:
- Working implementation on {branch_name}
- Complete memory log in `.agor/{agent_id.lower()}-memory.md`
- Communication entries in `.agor/agentconvo.md`
- Design rationale and known limitations

REVIEW PREPARATION:
After completion, you will review other agents' solutions and propose synthesis.
