## CONCRETE WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Project: {project_description}
### Team Size: {team_size} agents
### Project Type: {project_type}
### Complexity: {complexity}
### Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

{_generate_workflow_phases(project_type, complexity, team_size)}

## AGENT WORKFLOW ASSIGNMENTS

{_generate_workflow_assignments(team_size, project_type)}

## COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Phase Transition Rules:
```
PHASE_COMPLETE: [agent-id] - [phase-name] - [deliverables] - [timestamp]
PHASE_READY: [next-agent] - [phase-name] - [prerequisites-met] - [timestamp]
PHASE_BLOCKED: [agent-id] - [phase-name] - [blocker-description] - [timestamp]
```

### Quality Gates:
{_generate_workflow_quality_gates(complexity)}

### Snapshot Procedures:
{_generate_workflow_snapshots(project_type)}

## WORKFLOW EXECUTION

### Parallel Tracks:
{_generate_parallel_tracks(team_size, project_type)}

### Dependencies:
{_generate_workflow_dependencies(project_type, complexity)}

### Timeline:
{_generate_workflow_timeline(complexity, team_size)}

## ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Common Workflow Issues:
1. **Phase Blocking**: When one phase cannot proceed
   - **Detection**: Missing prerequisites, failed quality gates
   - **Resolution**: Rollback to previous phase, fix issues, retry
   - **Prevention**: Clear phase completion criteria

2. **Integration Conflicts**: When parallel work doesn't merge cleanly
   - **Detection**: Merge conflicts, API mismatches, test failures
   - **Resolution**: Integration agent coordinates resolution
   - **Prevention**: Regular integration checkpoints

3. **Resource Bottlenecks**: When agents are waiting for others
   - **Detection**: Idle agents, delayed phase transitions
   - **Resolution**: Rebalance work, add parallel tasks
   - **Prevention**: Load balancing, buffer tasks

4. **Quality Failures**: When deliverables don't meet standards
   - **Detection**: Failed quality gates, review rejections
   - **Resolution**: Return to development phase, address issues
   - **Prevention**: Continuous quality checks

### Recovery Procedures:
```
WORKFLOW_ISSUE: [agent-id] - [issue-type] - [description] - [timestamp]
RECOVERY_PLAN: [coordinator] - [steps] - [timeline] - [timestamp]
RECOVERY_COMPLETE: [agent-id] - [resolution] - [lessons-learned] - [timestamp]
```

## WORKFLOW MONITORING

### Progress Tracking:
- **Phase Completion**: Percentage complete for each phase
- **Agent Utilization**: Active vs idle time for each agent
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect rates, rework percentage
- **Timeline Adherence**: Actual vs planned phase durations

### Performance Indicators:
- **Velocity**: Features completed per sprint
- **Quality**: Bug rates, review feedback scores
- **Efficiency**: Rework percentage, idle time
- **Collaboration**: Snapshot success rate, communication frequency

## WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION

### Continuous Improvement:
1. **Weekly Retrospectives**: What worked, what didn't, improvements
2. **Metrics Review**: Analyze performance indicators, identify bottlenecks
3. **Process Refinement**: Adjust phases, snapshots, quality gates
4. **Tool Enhancement**: Improve coordination tools and templates

### Adaptation Triggers:
- **Performance Degradation**: Velocity drops, quality issues increase
- **Team Changes**: New agents, role changes, skill gaps
- **Project Evolution**: Scope changes, new requirements, technology shifts
- **External Factors**: Timeline pressure, resource constraints
