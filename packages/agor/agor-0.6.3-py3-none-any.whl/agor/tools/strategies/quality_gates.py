## QUALITY GATES IMPLEMENTATION

### Project: {project_name}
### Quality Focus: {quality_focus}
### Automation Level: {automation_level}
### Generated: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

## ACTIVE QUALITY GATES

{_generate_active_quality_gates(quality_focus)}

## QUALITY GATE EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

### Gate Validation Process:
1. **Gate Trigger**: Automatic detection when deliverable is ready
   ```
   GATE_TRIGGERED: [gate-name] - [deliverable] - [timestamp] - [responsible-agent]
   ```

2. **Quality Validation**: Execute all gate criteria checks
   ```
   GATE_VALIDATION: [gate-name] - [criteria-checked] - [pass/fail] - [details]
   ```

3. **Gate Decision**: Go/no-go decision based on validation results
   ```
   GATE_DECISION: [gate-name] - [PASS/FAIL] - [score] - [next-action]
   ```

4. **Gate Communication**: Notify stakeholders of gate results
   ```
   GATE_NOTIFICATION: [stakeholders] - [gate-name] - [result] - [impact]
   ```

### Gate Failure Handling:
1. **Immediate Response**: Stop progression, identify issues
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine why gate failed
3. **Remediation Plan**: Create plan to address issues
4. **Re-validation**: Re-run gate after fixes
5. **Process Improvement**: Update gates based on learnings
