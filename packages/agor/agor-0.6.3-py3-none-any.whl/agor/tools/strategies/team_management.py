```

### Automated Metrics Tracking:
```python
# Track performance metrics
def collect_team_metrics(team_size):
    return {
        'velocity': team_size * 2.5,  # Estimated tasks per day
        'quality_score': 8.5,  # Quality score out of 10
        'collaboration_index': min(10, team_size * 1.8)  # Collaboration index
    }

print(f"Quality score: {{metrics['quality_score']}}/10")
print(f"Collaboration index: {{metrics['collaboration_index']}}/10")
```

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Initialize Team Management**: Set up coordination files and protocols
2. **Establish Baselines**: Collect initial performance metrics
3. **Begin Daily Routine**: Start daily status checks and progress reviews
