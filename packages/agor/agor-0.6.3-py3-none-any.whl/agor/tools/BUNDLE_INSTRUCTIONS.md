# AgentOrchestrator (AGOR) - Bundle Mode Instructions

## Bundle Mode for ChatGPT Upload

**Bundle Mode** is for AI platforms that work with file uploads (currently ChatGPT).

### Step 1: Install AGOR Locally

```bash
# Install using pipx (recommended)
pipx install agor

# Or using pip
pip install agor
```

### Step 2: Bundle Your Project

```bash
# Bundle all branches (default, creates .tar.gz)
agor bundle /path/to/your/project

# Bundle with .zip format (for Google AI Studio)
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -f zip

# Bundle only main/master branch
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -m

# Bundle main/master + specific branches
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -b feature1,feature2


```

### Step 3: Upload to AI Platform

1. **Upload the bundle file** to your chosen AI platform:
   - **Google AI Studio**: Upload the .zip file (Pro models available)
   - **ChatGPT**: Upload the .tar.gz file (requires subscription)
   - **Other platforms**: Use appropriate format
2. **Copy and paste the prompt** that AGOR generated
3. **The AI will extract** the bundle and initialize AGOR protocol

### Step 4: Select Your Role

The AI will ask you to choose your primary role:

**üîπ Single Agent Mode:**

**a) üîç Worker Agent** - Analyze, edit, and answer questions about the codebase

- Focus on detailed codebase analysis and direct code work
- Emphasizes code exploration tools and editing capabilities
- Best for: Code review, debugging, implementation, technical analysis, solo development

**üîπ Multi-Agent Mode:**

**b) üìã PROJECT COORDINATOR** - Plan and coordinate multi-agent development

- Focus on strategic planning and team coordination
- Emphasizes planning tools and multi-agent strategies
- Best for: Project planning, team design, workflow orchestration

- Focus on executing specific tasks and coordination
- Best for: Specialized development tasks, following coordinator plans

### Step 5: Begin Work

Based on your role selection, the AI will initialize with:

- Your complete project codebase
- Role-appropriate AGOR tools and hotkeys
- Coordination and communication capabilities
- Strategic planning frameworks (if coordinator)

## Bundle Mode vs Agent Mode

**Bundle Mode (This Mode) - For Upload-Based AI Platforms:**

- **Requires local installation** - user installs AGOR locally
- **File upload workflow** - user bundles project and uploads archive
- **Multiple format support** - .zip for Google AI Studio, .tar.gz for ChatGPT
- **Self-contained** - everything bundled in one file including portable git binary
- **‚úÖ Successfully tested with**:
  - **Google AI Studio Pro models** (Function Calling enabled, use .zip)
  - **ChatGPT** (requires subscription, use .tar.gz)
  - **Claude** and other platforms that accept file uploads

**Agent Mode - For AI Agents with Direct Git Access:**

- **No installation required** - just clone the AGOR repository
- **Direct repository access** - can work with any repository URL
- **No file size limitations** - full repository access
- **Real-time updates** - can pull latest AGOR improvements
- **For**: Augment Code, Jules by Google, other advanced AI agents

## Bundle Contents

When you create a bundle, AGOR includes:

1. **Your project files** with git history and branch information
2. **AGOR tools** - All coordination and analysis tools
3. **Git binary** - Portable git for ChatGPT environment
4. **AI instructions** - Complete protocol for ChatGPT to follow

## Troubleshooting

### Large Repository Issues

If your repository is very large:

```bash
# Bundle only main branch to reduce size
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -m

# Or bundle specific branches only
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -b main,develop
```

### Upload Limits

- ChatGPT has file size limits for uploads
- Use branch selection to reduce bundle size
- Consider using Agent Mode for very large projects

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install AGOR
pipx install agor

# 2. Bundle your project
agor bundle ~/my-project

# 3. Upload my-project.tar.gz to ChatGPT

# 4. Paste the generated prompt

# 5. ChatGPT becomes AgentOrchestrator and analyzes your project
```

## üß† Memory Synchronization System

AGOR uses an automated Memory Synchronization System that manages memory persistence using git branches. This provides reliable, version-controlled memory management without requiring any additional setup.

### How It Works

**Automatic Memory Management**:

- Agent memories stored in markdown files (`.agor/memory.md`, `agent-N-memory.md`)
- Automatic synchronization to dedicated git branches (`agor/mem/TIMESTAMP`)
- Cross-agent coordination logs in `.agor/agentconvo.md`
- Project state management in `.agor/memory.md`

**Standard Hotkeys**:

- `mem-add`, `mem-search` - Memory operations with markdown files
- `snapshot` - Create work snapshots
- `load_snapshot` - Load previous snapshots

### Key Benefits

**Production Ready**:

- **No Setup Required**: Works automatically with any git repository
- **Version Controlled**: All memory changes are tracked in git history
- **Human Readable**: Memory files are markdown for easy inspection
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system with git support
- **Reliable**: Battle-tested git infrastructure ensures data persistence

### When Memory Sync Is Used

**Always Active**:

- Solo development with context preservation
- Multi-agent coordination workflows
- Project state management across sessions
- Snapshot-based work handoffs
