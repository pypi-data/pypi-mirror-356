# üéº AgentOrchestrator (AGOR)

**Multi-Agent Development Coordination Platform**

Transform AI assistants into sophisticated development coordinators. Plan complex projects, design specialized agent teams, and orchestrate coordinated development workflows.

**Supports**: Linux, macOS, Windows | **Primary Platforms**: ChatGPT, AugmentCode, Google AI Studio

> **üî¨ Alpha Protocol**: AGOR coordination strategies are actively evolving based on real-world usage. [Contribute feedback](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor/issues) to help shape AI coordination patterns.

> **üöß Under Construction**: We're still figuring out what works and what doesn't for the dev tools, so be warned some functionality might be broken.

## üöÄ Installation & Deployment

AGOR supports multiple deployment modes for different AI platforms and workflows. Choose the approach that matches your environment:

**üì¶ Bundle Mode** - Upload-based platforms - Google AI Studio, ChatGPT (not Codex)
**üöÄ Standalone Mode** - Direct git access - AugmentCode Remote, Jules by Google (limited support), Codex (currently untested)
**üè† Local Integration** - Workspace integration (AugmentCode Local Agent)

AGOR facilitates AI-driven development through seamless context transfer and programmatic coordination tools. While the name "Orchestrator" suggests a multi-agent focus, AGOR's robust protocols for structured work, context management (especially via its snapshot capabilities), and tool integration are highly valuable even for **solo developers**. The core value lies in **transferring context between agents with minimal friction** and using development tools to programmatically guide agents through common tasks, reducing the need for specific instructions each time. Understanding these coordination capabilities is key to leveraging AGOR effectively, whether working alone or in a team.

## üîÑ Operational Modes

AGOR enhances the original AgentGrunt capabilities by offering two primary operational modes with improved multi-agent coordination and flexible deployment options:

### üöÄ Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**For agents with repository access** (AugmentCode Remote Agents, Jules by Google, etc.)

- **Direct commits**: Agents can make commits directly if they have commit access
- **Fallback method**: Copy-paste codeblocks if no commit access
- **Full git operations**: Branch creation, merging, pull requests
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple agents working on live repositories
- **No file size limits**: Complete repository access

### üì¶ Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**For upload-based platforms** (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.)

- **Copy-paste workflow**: Users manually copy edited files from agent output
- **Manual commits**: Users handle git operations themselves
- **Platform flexibility**: Works with any AI platform that accepts file uploads
- **Free tier compatible**: Excellent for Google AI Studio Pro (free)

> **üí° Key Point**: All AGOR roles (Worker Agent, Project Coordinator) function effectively in both Standalone and Bundled modes. The primary difference lies in how code changes are applied: direct Git commits are possible in Standalone Mode (if the agent has access), while Bundled Mode typically relies on a copy-paste workflow where the user handles the final commit.

## üéØ Core Capabilities & Features

AGOR structures AI-driven development through distinct roles and a powerful set of tools:

**üîπ Worker Agent**: Focuses on deep codebase analysis, implementation, debugging, and answering technical questions. Ideal for solo development tasks, feature implementation, and executing specific tasks within a coordinated workflow. This role is crucial for hands-on development and detailed technical work.

**üîπ Project Coordinator**: Handles strategic planning, designs multi-agent workflows, and orchestrates team activities. Best suited for project oversight, breaking down complex tasks, strategy design, and overall team coordination. This role ensures that development efforts are aligned and progressing efficiently.

### Advanced Coordination Concepts (Experimental)

AGOR is exploring several advanced strategies for multi-agent collaboration. These are currently experimental and represent future directions for the framework:

- **Parallel Divergent**: Independent exploration by multiple agents, followed by peer review and synthesis of solutions.
- **Pipeline**: Sequential task handling where work is passed between specialized agents via snapshots.
- **Swarm**: Dynamic task assignment from a shared queue to maximize parallelism.
- **Red Team**: Adversarial build/break cycles to improve robustness and identify weaknesses.
- **Mob Programming**: Collaborative coding where multiple agents (or an agent and humans) work together on the same task simultaneously.

### Key Features for Context Management and Development

AGOR provides tools designed to facilitate seamless development and effective context transfer, whether working solo or in a multi-agent team:

- **Structured Snapshot System**: Capture and transfer detailed work context between development sessions or different AI agents, ensuring continuity and shared understanding. This is crucial for complex tasks and effective handoffs.
- **Agent Handoff Prompts**: Generate clear, actionable prompts for transferring tasks and context to another agent, detailing work completed, current status, and next steps.
- **Integrated Memory System**: Persist important information, decisions, and learnings using markdown files synchronized with Git branches. This allows agents to maintain context over time and across different tasks.
- **Git Integration**: A portable Git binary enables direct version control operations within the agent's environment, facilitating standard development practices.
- **Codebase Analysis Tools**: Explore and understand codebases with language-specific tools, aiding in efficient navigation and comprehension.
