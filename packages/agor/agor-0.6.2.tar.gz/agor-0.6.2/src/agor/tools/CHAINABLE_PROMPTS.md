# AGOR Chainable Initialization Prompts

**Token-efficient prompts for various AGOR scenarios**

These prompts are designed to maximize token efficiency by combining AGOR initialization with specific task instructions. Each prompt ends with the chainable comment, allowing you to add your detailed instructions without requiring a separate initialization step.

## üö® CRITICAL: Snapshot System Requirement

**ALL agents using these prompts MUST provide a comprehensive snapshot in a single codeblock before ending their session.** This is mandatory for context preservation and coordination. Read `SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.

## üéØ General Purpose Prompts

### Universal AGOR Initialization

```
I'm working with the AGOR (AgentOrchestrator) framework for multi-agent development coordination.

Please read these key files to understand the system:

## üí° Usage Guidelines

### Token Efficiency Tips

1. **Choose the most specific prompt** for your use case
2. **Combine initialization with task details** after the chainable comment
3. **Reference specific AGOR files** only when needed for your task
4. **Use role-specific prompts** when you know your role in advance

### Customization Examples

**Example 1: Feature Development**

```
[Use Feature Development Planning prompt above]

# <--- Add your detailed step-by-step instructions below --->

1. Analyze the current authentication system
2. Plan integration of OAuth 2.0 support
3. Design database schema changes
4. Create implementation timeline with milestones
5. Set up testing strategy for the new feature
```

**Example 2: Code Review**

```
[Use Code Review and Analysis prompt above]

# <--- Add your detailed step-by-step instructions below --->

1. Review the recent changes in the user management module
2. Check for security vulnerabilities in authentication code
3. Assess code quality and adherence to project standards
4. Identify opportunities for performance optimization
5. Suggest refactoring improvements
```

### Best Practices

- **Be specific** in your additional instructions
- **Reference file paths** when asking for specific file analysis
- **Include context** about your project's current state
- **Mention constraints** like deadlines or technical requirements
- **Specify deliverables** you expect from the session
