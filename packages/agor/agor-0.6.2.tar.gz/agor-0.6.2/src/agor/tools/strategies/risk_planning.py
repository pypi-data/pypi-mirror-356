### Deep Risk Analysis

#### Risk Assessment Matrix
For each identified risk, evaluate:

**Probability Assessment (1-5 scale):**
- 1: Very Low (0-5% chance)
- 2: Low (6-25% chance)
- 3: Medium (26-50% chance)
- 4: High (51-75% chance)
- 5: Very High (76-100% chance)

**Impact Assessment (1-5 scale):**
- 1: Minimal (minor inconvenience)
- 2: Low (small delays or costs)
- 3: Medium (moderate impact on timeline/budget)
- 4: High (significant impact on project success)
- 5: Critical (project failure or major business impact)

**Risk Score Calculation:**
Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact

**Risk Categorization:**
- 20-25: Critical Risk (immediate attention required)
- 15-19: High Risk (priority mitigation needed)
- 10-14: Medium Risk (mitigation planning required)
- 5-9: Low Risk (monitoring sufficient)
- 1-4: Minimal Risk (acknowledge and document)

#### Risk Interdependency Analysis
- **Cascading Risks**: How one risk can trigger others
- **Risk Clusters**: Groups of related risks
- **Amplification Effects**: Risks that magnify other risks
- **Risk Correlation**: Risks that tend to occur together

#### Temporal Risk Analysis
- **Risk Timeline**: When risks are most likely to occur
- **Risk Evolution**: How risks change over time
- **Critical Periods**: Project phases with highest risk exposure
- **Risk Windows**: Time-sensitive risk factors

#### Quantitative Risk Analysis
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Probabilistic risk modeling
- **Expected Value Calculation**: Financial impact estimation
- **Risk Exposure Calculation**: Total risk exposure assessment
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Impact of risk parameter changes

### Standard Risk Analysis

#### Risk Scoring (1-3 scale)
**Probability:**
- 1: Low (unlikely to occur)
- 2: Medium (possible occurrence)
- 3: High (likely to occur)

**Impact:**
- 1: Low (minor impact)
- 2: Medium (moderate impact)
- 3: High (major impact)

**Risk Priority:**
- 6-9: High Priority (immediate action)
- 4-5: Medium Priority (planned mitigation)
- 1-3: Low Priority (monitoring)

#### Risk Categories
- **Critical Risks**: High probability and high impact
- **Watch List**: Medium probability or impact
- **Monitored Risks**: Low probability and impact

#### Risk Relationships
- **Dependent Risks**: Risks that depend on other risks
- **Independent Risks**: Standalone risk factors
- **Compound Risks**: Multiple risks affecting same area
