### Red Team (Attackers)

## CURRENT CYCLE: Blue Team Build Phase

### Blue Team Rules:
1. **Build secure solution** - Focus on security from the start
2. **Document security measures** - Record all security decisions
3. **Prepare for attack** - Anticipate potential vulnerabilities
4. **Signal completion** - Post "BLUE_BUILD_COMPLETE" when ready

### Red Team Rules:
1. **Prepare attack strategies** - Plan your attack approach
2. **Research vulnerabilities** - Study common attack vectors
3. **Wait for blue team** - Do not attack until build phase complete
4. **Document attack plans** - Record your attack strategies

### Cycle Completion:
When blue team signals completion, red team attack phase begins automatically.

## DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS

### Blue Team Phase 1: Secure Build
1. **Security-First Development**: Build {task} with security as primary concern
2. **Threat Modeling**: Consider potential attack vectors
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow security best practices
4. **Documentation**: Record all security measures implemented
5. **Testing**: Test for basic security vulnerabilities
6. **Completion Signal**: Post "BLUE_BUILD_COMPLETE" when ready for attack

### Red Team Phase 1: Attack Preparation
1. **Attack Planning**: Develop comprehensive attack strategies
2. **Tool Preparation**: Prepare security testing tools
3. **Vulnerability Research**: Research common vulnerabilities for this type of system
4. **Attack Documentation**: Document planned attack vectors
5. **Wait for Signal**: Begin attacks only after blue team completion signal

### Red Team Phase 2: Attack Execution
1. **Systematic Testing**: Execute planned attacks methodically
2. **Vulnerability Discovery**: Document all vulnerabilities found
3. **Exploit Development**: Develop working exploits for vulnerabilities
4. **Impact Assessment**: Assess business impact of vulnerabilities
5. **Attack Report**: Comprehensive report of findings and recommendations

### Blue Team Phase 2: Defense and Hardening
1. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Review red team findings
2. **Security Hardening**: Fix identified vulnerabilities
3. **Additional Protections**: Implement additional security measures
4. **Testing**: Verify fixes and test against known attacks
5. **Documentation**: Update security documentation

### Cycle Completion and Iteration
- After blue team hardens, red team attacks again
- Continue cycles until no critical vulnerabilities remain
- Final deliverable: Secure, battle-tested implementation
