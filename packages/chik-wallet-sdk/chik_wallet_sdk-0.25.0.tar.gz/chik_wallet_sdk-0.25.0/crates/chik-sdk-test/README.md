This is a library for building applications that need to interact with coins on the [Chik blockchain](https://chiknetwork.com), including wallets and dApps (decentralized apps). However, it is _not_ a prebuilt wallet. If you are looking for that, you can use [Saga Wallet](https://github.com/chik-network/saga), which is a light wallet built using the Wallet SDK that provides an RPC interface.

## Getting Started

To learn more about developing applications on Chik, I'd recommend [xch.dev](https://xch.dev).

There are also [Rust docs](https://docs.rs/chik-wallet-sdk/latest/chik_wallet_sdk) will get you going with the crate, and assume you are already familiar with Rust and Chik's coin set model.
