class Document(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents a document, capable of storing raw text and/or a structured collection
    of paragraphs, which can in turn contain sentences.

    This class provides functionalities for segmenting text into paragraphs and sentences,
    and for retrieving filtered content based on regular expressions and reference depth.

    Attributes:
        raw_text (Optional[NonEmptyStr]): The raw, unsegmented text of the document.
                                           Cannot be reassigned once set to a truthy value.
        paragraphs (list[Paragraph]): A list of Paragraph objects representing the
                                      segmented content of the document.
                                      Cannot be reassigned once populated.
        paragraph_segmentation_mode (Literal["newlines", 'empty_line', "sat"]):
            The method used for segmenting raw_text into paragraphs.
            - "newlines": Segments by newline characters.
            - "empty_line": Segments by empty lines.
            - "sat": Uses a SaT (Semantic Augmentation Tool) model for segmentation.
            Defaults to "empty_line".
        sat_model_id (SaTModelId): The identifier for the SaT model to be used for
                                   segmentation (both paragraphs and sentences, if "sat" mode is used).
                                   Defaults to "sat-3l-sm".
        regex_pattern (Optional[NonEmptyStr]): A regular expression pattern that can
                                               be used for filtering paragraphs or sentences.
                                               Defaults to None.

        Segments the document's raw text into paragraphs and, subsequently,

        Paragraph segmentation is determined by `paragraph_segmentation_mode`.
        Sentence segmentation within paragraphs always uses the SaT model.

        Actions performed:
        1. If `raw_text` is present but `paragraphs` are not, it extracts paragraphs
           based on `paragraph_segmentation_mode` ("newlines", "empty_line", or "sat").
           It then assigns these newly created `Paragraph` objects to `self.paragraphs`.
           A validation step ensures all segmented paragraphs are present in the original `raw_text`.
        2. If `paragraphs` exist but some do not have extracted sentences, it extracts
           sentences for those paragraphs using the SaT model identified by `sat_model_id`.
           Existing sentences in paragraphs are preserved.
