{% if extraction_type == "money" %}
**Monetary Extraction Details:** You task is to extract all monetary information with a currency.
Please extract all the explicit possible monetary information from the following {% if reference_depth == "paragraphs" %}paragraphs{% else %}sentences{% endif %} and provide it in a JSON array format. 
Each distinct {% if reference_depth == "paragraphs" %}paragraph{% else %}sentence{% endif %} will be separated by an empty line. Also, the {% if reference_depth == "paragraphs" %}paragraphs{% else %}sentences{% endif %} below are unrelated to each other.

It is possible that the input text does not have any monetary information.

If no monetary details are found, do not attempt to force an extraction.

Focus on monetary information with currency symbol (e.g., €, $, £, ¥) or a clear currency code (e.g., EUR, USD, GBP, JPY). Numbers associated to elements not related to currencies (e.g., points, units, pieces, percentage) MUST be ignored.
