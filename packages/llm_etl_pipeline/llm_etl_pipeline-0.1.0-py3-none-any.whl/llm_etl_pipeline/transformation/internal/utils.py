    """
    Clusters a list of sentences semantically and returns the longest sentence from each cluster.

    This function utilizes Sentence-BERT to generate embeddings for the input sentences, followed by
    hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Sentences are grouped into clusters if their cosine
    distance is below the specified `threshold`. For each resulting cluster, the longest sentence
    is chosen as its representative. If the input list contains only one sentence, clustering is
    bypassed, and the original list is returned directly.

    Args:
        input_list (NonEmptyListStr): A list of strings (sentences) to be clustered. Must not be empty.
        threshold (StrictFloat): The maximum cosine distance for sentences to be considered
                                 part of the same cluster. Defaults to 0.8.
        model_st (SentenceTransformer): An initialized SentenceTransformer model for generating
                                        sentence embeddings. If None, it implies an external
                                        caller handles model loading.
        hierarchical_clustering (AgglomerativeClustering): An initialized AgglomerativeClustering
                                                           model configured for hierarchical clustering.
                                                           If None, it implies an external caller
                                                           handles model initialization.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of representative sentences, where each sentence is the longest
                   from its respective cluster.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If there's an issue generating sentence embeddings or performing
                    hierarchical clustering.
