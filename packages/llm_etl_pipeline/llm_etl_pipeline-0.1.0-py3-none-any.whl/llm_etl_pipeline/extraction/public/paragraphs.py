class Paragraph(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents a fundamental text segment of a document, containing its raw text
    content and an ordered collection of constituent sentences.

    Paragraph instances are designed to be **immutable text segments** at the `raw_text`
    level. Once the `raw_text` is set during initialization, it cannot be changed.
    Similarly, once the `sentences` list is populated (i.e., not empty), it cannot
    be reassigned to maintain data integrity and consistency throughout analysis.

    Attributes:
        raw_text (NonEmptyStr): The complete, non-empty text content of the paragraph.
                                This attribute is **frozen** after initialization,
                                meaning its value cannot be altered.
        sentences (list[Sentence]): A list of `Sentence` objects that are part of this
                                    paragraph. Defaults to an empty list. This list
                                    cannot be reassigned once it contains elements.

    Note:
        Typically, you won't need to manually construct `Paragraph` objects. They are
        automatically generated and populated by the `Document` class during its
        text segmentation process. Use this constructor primarily for advanced scenarios,
        such as when integrating a custom paragraph segmentation tool.

        Custom attribute setter that applies restrictions on specific attributes.

        sentences after they've been established.
