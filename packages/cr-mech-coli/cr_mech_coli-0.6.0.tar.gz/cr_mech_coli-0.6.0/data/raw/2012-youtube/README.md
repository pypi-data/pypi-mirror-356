# Bacterial growth under the microscope, Rate My Science (Youtube)

## Description
http://ratemyscience.com/ Bacterial growth is the division of one bacterium into two daughter
cells in a process called binary fission.
Providing no mutational event occurs the resulting daughter cells are genetically identical to the
original cell.
Hence, "local doubling" of the bacterial population occurs.
Both daughter cells from the division do not necessarily survive.
However, if the number surviving exceeds unity on average, the bacterial population undergoes
exponential growth.
The measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in batch culture was traditionally a part
of the training of all microbiologists; the basic means requires bacterial enumeration (cell
counting) by direct and individual (microscopic, flow cytometry), direct and bulk (biomass),
indirect and individual (colony counting), or indirect and bulk (most probable number, turbidity,
nutrient uptake) methods.
Models reconcile theory with the measurements

## Obtaining the Data
We provide a small bash script `obtain.sh` in order to obtain the movie, extract images and sort
them into subfolders.
The script requires `wget` and `ffmpeg` to be installed.

```bash
./obtain.sh
```
