## ü§î why `pyutube`?

This command-line wizard lets you download YouTube videos or playlists straight from your `Terminal`, powered by [Pytubefix](https://pytubefix.readthedocs.io/). It works like a charm on Windows, Mac, and Linux, so you can rock it on any platform.

While other tools make you wade through a swamp of settings and configs, `Pyutube` keeps it simple. Just drop in your URL, and voil√†! It‚Äôll take you on a smooth ride to your favorite videos, no complex options needed‚Äîjust fun downloading! üî•

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Getting `Pyutube` up and running is a breeze! First, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org) installed. Just pop open your terminal and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see something like `Python 3.x`, you‚Äôre all set! If not, head over to [Python's downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to grab it.

Once you‚Äôre good to go, install `Pyutube` with a single command:

```bash
pip install pyutube --break-system-packages
```

And just like that, you‚Äôre ready to download some awesome videos! üéâ

## üìà Upgrade

Stay in the loop with the latest features on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hetari/pyutube)! To upgrade your `Pyutube` tool, simply run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pyutube --break-system-packages
```

Then you‚Äôre all set to keep downloading from your `Terminal`! ü•≥

## ü¶∏ Quick Start

Getting started with `Pyutube` is a piece of cake! Just use the following command style:

```bash
pyutube "YOUTUBE_LINK" [PATH]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `[URL]` is <span style="color:red">[Required]</span> and it should be between `""`<br/>
> The `[PATH]` is optional‚Äîif you don‚Äôt specify one, it‚Äôll save to your current terminal directory. Easy-peasy!
