        The dispatcher is a message routing system that enables communication between
        components across instances. It handles:
        - Request forwarding between schedulers on different instances
        - Reply routing for request-response patterns

        Schedulers that operate in isolation don't need the dispatcher client.
        However, schedulers that are part of a distributed pipeline require the
        dispatcher client to communicate with their counterparts.

        When this method returns True, the ModelWorker will start the dispatcher client
        before running the scheduler, enabling distributed message passing.

        Returns False by default. Schedulers that use dispatcher client
        should override this method to return True.

        Returns:
            bool: True if the scheduler requires dispatcher client startup, False otherwise.
