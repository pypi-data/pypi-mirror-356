# MCP Alchemy Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the testing of MCP Alchemy, a tool that connects Claude Desktop directly to databases, allowing Claude to explore database structures, write and validate SQL queries, display relationships between tables, and analyze large datasets.

**Test Date:** May 2, 2025  
**MCP Alchemy Version:** 2025.5.2.210242  
**Database Engine:** MySQL 5.7.36

## Test Environment

Testing was performed on a MySQL database with the following characteristics:
- Over 350 tables
- Complex schema with extensive relationships
- Real-world data structure with various data types

## Features Tested

### 1. Database Information Retrieval

- **Get Database Info**: Successfully verified connection information
- **List All Tables**: Retrieved complete list of all 367 database tables
- **Filter Tables**: Successfully filtered tables by substring pattern

### 2. Schema Analysis

- **Table Schema Definition**: Successfully retrieved detailed schema including:
  - Column names and types
  - Primary keys
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Nullable flags
  - Default values
  
- **Complex Table Relationships**: Successfully mapped and displayed relationships between tables

### 3. Query Execution

- **Basic Queries**: Executed simple SELECT queries to retrieve data
- **Parameterized Queries**: Successfully used parameterized queries with the params argument
- **Complex Joins**: Successfully performed queries with multiple joins across related tables
- **Error Handling**: Properly handled and reported errors for invalid queries
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Verified that SQL injection attempts are properly neutralized

### 4. Output Formatting

- **Vertical Display Format**: Confirmed that query results are displayed in clear vertical format
- **NULL Value Display**: Properly formats NULL values as "NULL"
- **Row Counting**: Correctly displays the number of rows returned
- **Output Truncation**: Properly truncates large result sets with appropriate notifications
- **Full Result Access**: Successfully generated URLs for complete result sets via claude-local-files
