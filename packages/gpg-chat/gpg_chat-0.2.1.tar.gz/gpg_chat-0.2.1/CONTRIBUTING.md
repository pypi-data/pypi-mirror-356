Some gpg chat tui

- **Gitlab repository**: <https://gitlab.com/Diabeul/gpg-chat/>
- **Documentation** <https://Diabeul.gitlab.io/gpg-chat/>

## Getting started with your project

### 1. Create a New Repository

First, create a repository on gitlab with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:Diabeul/gpg-chat.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Then, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
make install
```

This will also generate your `uv.lock` file

### 3. Run the pre-commit hooks

Initially, the CI/CD pipeline might be failing due to formatting issues. To resolve those run:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run -a
```

### 4. Commit the changes

Lastly, commit the changes made by the two steps above to your repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Fix formatting issues'
git push origin main
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!
The CI/CD pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main, or when you create a new release.
