A fast elliptical accretion disk modeling engine written with NumPyro and Jax.

`feadme` is a highly efficient and flexible framework for modeling elliptical 
accretion disks. It leverages the power of Jax and NumPyro to provide fast 
computations and easy-to-use interfaces for astrophysical modeling of 
double-peaked emission line features in spectra.

`feadme` implements the elliptical accretion disk model as described in 
[Eracleous et al. (1995)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...438..610E/abstract).

## Features

- **Fast Computation**: Utilizes Jax for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.
- **Flexible Modeling**: Leverages the No-U-Turn gradient-based sampler to 
  provide optimized convergence and exploration of parameter space.
- **Probabilistic Programming**: Built on NumPyro for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use API for defining model templates.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extended for custom sampler 
  implementations.

## Installation

The installation of `feadme` is platform-dependent as the installation requires
libraries specific to the platform resources. Refer to the table below for
installation instructions based on available resources of your platform.

| Platform | Installation Command |
|----------|----------------------|
| CPU      | `pip install feadme` |
| GPU      | `pip install feadme[gpu]` |
| TPU      | `pip install feadme[tpu]` |

Or, to install directly from the GitHub repository, you can use:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/nmearl/feadme.git
````

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, there is a bug upstream for the GPU installation. If you encounter
> an issue with running `feadme` on a GPU, please ensure your `nvidia-cublas-cu12`
> package version is compatible:
>
> ```bash
> $ pip install "nvidia-cublas-cu12==12.9.0.13"
> ````

### Developer Installation

For developers who want to contribute to the `feadme` codebase, you can install
the package in editable mode with all optional dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nmearl/feadme.git
$ cd feadme
$ pip install -e .[dev,gpu]  # or [tpu] for TPU support
```

## Usage

`feadme` provides a simple interface for generating disk fits and follows the
structure below:

```bash
Usage: feadme [OPTIONS] TEMPLATE_PATH DATA_PATH

Options:
  --output-path PATH     Directory to save output files and plots. Defaults to
                         './output'.
  --sampler-type [nuts]  Type of NumPyro sampler to use.
  --num-warmup INTEGER   Number of warmup steps for the MCMC sampler.
  --num-samples INTEGER  Number of samples to draw from the posterior
                         distribution.
  --num-chains INTEGER   Number of MCMC chains to run.
  --progress-bar         Display a progress bar during sampling.
  --pre-fit              Run a pre-fit using the least-squares model fitter
                         before sampling.
  --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

As an example, to run a model fit you can use the following command:

```bash
feadme my_template.json my_data.csv --num-warmup 1000 --num-samples 5000 --num-chains 2
```

## Data Format

The data parser is currently designed to handle CSV files with three defined 
columns. The column names do not matter.

- **First column**: Wavelength values in `Angstrom`s.
- **Second column**: Flux values in `mJy`.
- **Third column**: Uncertainties in `mJy`.

## Template Format

To use `feadme`, you must provide a JSON configuration file that defines the 
model components and their parameter priors. This file serves as the input 
"template" describing the physical and statistical structure of your emission 
line model.

### Top-Level Fields

The JSON file must include the following keys:

* **`name`**: A descriptive name for the model or target.
* **`redshift`**: The redshift of the source.
* **[Optional] `obs_date`**: Date of observation for target.
* **`disk_profiles`**: A list of disk-like emission components.
* **`line_profiles`**: A list of line components.
* **`mask`**: A list of wavelength intervals to include in the fit.

### Defining Disk and Line Profiles

Each entry in `disk_profiles` or `line_profiles` represents a parameterized 
model component, and the definitions of these parameters are used to construct 
the prior distributions for the sampling. All model parameters (e.g. `center`, 
`sigma`, `inclination`, `amplitude`, etc.) must follow this structure:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "<string>", // unique name for the parameter
  "distribution": "<string>", // distribution type: "uniform", "log_uniform", "normal", or "log_normal"
  "value": "<null | float>", // null for sampling, float for fixed value
  "fixed": "<true | false>", // true if the parameter is fixed at "value"
  "shared": "<null | string>", // name of another **profile** that contains the same **parameter name** to link to
  "low": "<float>", // lower bound
  "high": "<float>", // upper bound
  "loc": "<float>", // center of the prior (used in normal distributions)
  "scale": "<float>",  // width of the prior (used in normal distributions)
  "circular": "<true | false>" // true if the parameter is circular (e.g., angles)
}
```

* Set `"fixed": true` to lock the parameter at `"value"`.
* Use `"shared"` to link this parameter to one from another component.
* Set `"circular": true` for angular variables (e.g., azimuthal angles).

Each `disk_profile` must define these physical parameters:

* `center`: the central wavelength of the emission line (in `Angstrom`s), 
* `inner_radius`: the inner radius of the disk (in gravitational radii units `R_g`),
* `delta_radius`: the radial width of the disk (in `R_g`),
* `inclination`: the inclination angle of the disk (in radians),
* `sigma`: the broadening component of the disk (in `km/s`),
* `q`: the emissivity profile power-law index,
* `eccentricity`: the eccentricity of the disk,
* `apocenter`: the apocenter of the disk (in radians),
* `scale`: the scale factor for the disk profile (unitless),
* `offset`: the offset of the disk profile (in `mJy`).

Each `line_profile` must define parameters for:

* `center`: the central wavelength of the emission line (in `Angstrom`s),
* `amplitude`: the amplitude of the line profile (in `mJy`),
* `vel_width`: the velocity width of the line profile (in `km/s`),
* [Optionally] `shape`: the shape of the line profile, ("gaussian" [default], "lorentzian")

### Notes

* Parameter names must be unique within each component.
* Units must be consistent (e.g., wavelengths in Angstroms, velocities in km/s).
* You may define relationships between parameters using `shared` references, where supported.
* The `shared` field requires the name of another **profile** that contains the same **parameter name** to link to.

        "circular": false
      }
    }

        "name": "center", 
        "distribution": "uniform", 
        "low": 6560.8, 
        "high": 6564.8, 
        "loc": 6562.8, 
        "scale": 2.0, 
        "shared": "halpha_disk", // will use the `center` parameter from the `halpha_disk` profile
        "fixed": false, 
        "value": null, 
        "circular": false
      }
    }
    // additional line profiles would be defined here
  ],
  "mask": [
    { 
      "lower_limit": 6400.0, 
      "upper_limit": 6800.0
    }
    // additional mask intervals can be defined here
  ]
}
```

## Important Note

Jax/NumPyro is designed to operate over physically distinct devices (CPU, GPU, TPU), and
so parallelization is handled at the device level. This means that when using
`feadme`, you should ensure that your setup appropriately distributes across
the available devices.

In practice, this means that if you are on a platform with a single CPU, Jax/NumPyro
will not parallelize across multiple CPU cores. Instead, it will vectorize
operations to maximize performance on that single device.

Likewise, parallelization is done at the chain level, meaning that
each MCMC chain will run independently on the available devices. If you are
running multiple chains, they will not share data or state, but will each
operate independently on the same dataset.

### Parallelization and Device Management

As mentioned, parallelization occurs at the device level, and over independent
MCMC chains. If you are working on a single CPU device, you can force Jax to treat
your CPU as multiple independent devices by setting the `FORCE_DEVICE_COUNT`
environment variable.

```bash
$ export FORCE_DEVICE_COUNT=4  # or any number of devices you want to simulate
```

Your single CPU device will then be treated as if it were multiple independent
devices, allowing you to run multiple MCMC chains in parallel.
