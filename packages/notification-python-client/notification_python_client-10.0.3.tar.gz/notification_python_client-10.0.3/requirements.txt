# Unlike in other repos these requirements are only needing for building the
# project, not installing/running it. This file still needs to be called
# `requirements.txt` so that the version_tools scripts in utils can inspect
# it to work out the current utils version

# Run `make bump-utils` to update to the latest version
# notifications-utils @ git+https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-utils.git@95.1.1
