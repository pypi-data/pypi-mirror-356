A powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides **dynamic YAML-driven workflow guidance** for AI coding agents. Features structured development workflows with progression control and decision points.

## What This Does

This server guides AI agents through structured, schema-driven development workflows:
- **üìã Dynamic YAML Workflows**: Custom workflows defined in YAML with schema-driven execution
- **üîç Discovery-First**: Automatically discovers and selects appropriate workflows based on task
- **‚ö° Real-time State**: Live workflow state tracking with comprehensive session management
- **üéØ Mandatory Guidance**: Authoritative phase-by-phase instructions agents must follow
- **ü§ñ Agent-Generated Workflows**: Unique capability for agents to create custom YAML workflows on-the-fly

### Two Workflow Approaches

### Built-in Workflow Discovery Process

1. **Automatic Discovery** - System scans `.accordo/workflows/` for available YAML workflows
2. **Intelligent Matching** - Analyzes task description against workflow capabilities and goals
3. **Workflow Selection** - Agent chooses the most appropriate workflow from discovered options
4. **Immediate Execution** - Selected workflow starts with full state management and progression control

This provides **instant access** to proven workflows for common development patterns - coding, documentation, debugging, and more!

### Agent Workflow Generation Process

1. **Analyze Task Requirements** - Agent understands specific needs
2. **Get Creation Guidance** - Comprehensive templates and best practices provided
3. **Generate Custom YAML** - Agent creates workflow tailored to exact requirements
4. **Start Execution** - Custom workflow runs with full state management

This enables agents to create workflows for **any domain** - web development, data science, DevOps, research, documentation, testing, and more!

## Quick Start

### Installing **accordo CLI**

The accordo CLI provides easy configuration and management of MCP servers. Install it directly with:

```bash
# Download and run the installation script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndurilCode/accordo/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- ‚úÖ Detect your environment (virtual env, available tools)
- üåç **Global installation (recommended)**: Uses pipx for system-wide access
- üì¶ **Virtual environment**: Uses uv or pip if you're in a venv
- üîß **Auto-setup**: Handles dependencies and PATH configuration

#### CLI Usage

```bash
# Configure MCP servers interactively
accordo configure

# Quick setup for specific platforms
accordo configure -p cursor -y
accordo configure -p claude-code -y

# Deploy workflow guidelines to AI assistants
accordo bootstrap-rules              # All assistants
accordo bootstrap-rules cursor       # Cursor only
accordo bootstrap-rules --force all  # Overwrite existing

# List supported platforms and manage servers
accordo list-platforms
accordo list-servers -p cursor
accordo validate -p cursor

# Get help
accordo --help
```

### Manual MCP Configuration

Alternatively, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management and configure your MCP client manually:
**For Cursor** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "accordo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["accordo-workflow-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the following link to install the MCP server (Cursor Installed):
