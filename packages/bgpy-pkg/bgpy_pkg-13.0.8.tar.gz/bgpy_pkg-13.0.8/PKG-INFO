Welcome to BGPy! One of the worlds leading Python BGP security simulators. You're in good company; this simulator has been used by teams all around the world, including NIST. BGPy is also [peer-reviewed research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3607505.3607509) and has been featured in [several publications](https://github.com/jfuruness/bgpy/wiki/Citations-and-Use-Cases), with many more ongoing.

With BGPy, you can simulate the entire internet topology on your laptop. You can program your own security policies & attacks, use the topology for custom analysis, use real-world ROV data, etc. BGPy also comes with a custom test suite that allows for easy testing of security protocols. We support [more than 20 policies](https://github.com/jfuruness/bgpy_pkg/wiki/Routing-Policies) including ROV, ASPA,  and ASRA.

If you're looking for an in depth tutorial as to the features, and how to use BGPy, I highly recommend the [tutorial](https://github.com/jfuruness/bgpy/wiki/Tutorial).

If you're just looking to run/visualize attack/defense scenarios without programming, I recommend checking out the front-end for this tool: [BGPSimulator.com](https://www.bgpsimulator.com)

If you're looking to cite BGPy or check out the use cases, you can find that [here](https://github.com/jfuruness/bgpy/wiki/Citations-and-Use-Cases). If you end up citing BGPy please let us know and we'll add you to the list :)
