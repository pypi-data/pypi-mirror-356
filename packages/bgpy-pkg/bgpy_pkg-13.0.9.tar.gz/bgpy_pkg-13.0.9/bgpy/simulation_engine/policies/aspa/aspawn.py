    """ASRA: Esentially ASPA and checking neighbors at every AS together

    NOTE: Updated 12/26/2024. This is the same as ASRA algo B, confirmed

    Originally we had this policy coded for ASPAwN, an extension of ASPA that
    we had developed independently of ASRA in parallel. Upon publishing an ASPA
    evaluation paper, we received feedback from an ASPA RFC author and converted
    ASPAwN into ASRA

    That being said, ASRA is not yet finalized, and at the time of this writing the
    draft wasn't even published. This policy assumes ASRA3 records (not specifying
    the neighbor type) and also assumes the strict algorithm.

    I also don't know why the draft is made out to be so complicated. I'm leaving
    the algorithm we used for ASPAwN below, as it's vastly simpler than the ASRA
    algorithm listed in the RFC but has the same effect. I've contacted an ASRA
    author and asked them to simplify it. Once ASRA becomes finalized I'll change
    the code below.
