# Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Indentation Error in Generated Code**
   - Fixed the code generation logic in `mcp_server_creator.py` to not add extra indentation to implementation code
   - Changed lines 326 and 357 to preserve the original indentation

2. **Multiple Client Connection Issue**
   - Combined all tests into a single connection in `test_mcp_creator.py`
   - Fixed the issue where trying to connect multiple times to the same server caused "Failed to initialize server session" errors

3. **F-string Syntax Error**
   - Fixed f-string with backslash issue on line 134 of `test_mcp_creator.py`

4. **Generated Example Files**
   - Created properly formatted `test_server_output.py` and `task_manager_server.py` 
   - These files now have correct indentation and can be run with FastMCP

## How to Test:

1. Run the MCP Server Creator:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   fastmcp run mcp_server_creator.py
   ```

2. In another terminal, test the generated servers:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   fastmcp run test_server_output.py
   # or
   fastmcp run task_manager_server.py
   ```

3. Use with a client or the test/example scripts

The MCP Server Creator is now working properly and generates correctly formatted Python code!
