    ### Scientific Paper to Audio Script Converter

    You will convert the scientific paper provided as an attached PDF into an audio-ready narration that a listener can enjoy hands-free.

    Follow **all** of these rules exactly:

    1. **Initial Summary** – open with:
       • the paper’s title (derive it from the document if necessary)
       • its general domain or research area
       • the main objectives or research questions
       • the key findings and conclusions
       • why the paper is significant
       Use the verbal format: “Today, we are discussing a paper titled ‘…’. It explores … . … . Now, let’s go through the paper itself.”

    2. **Main Body** – read the original text of the paper almost verbatim, with these strategic audio-only adjustments:
       • Insert clear verbal transitions between sections, for example: “We’re now beginning the Introduction section.”
       • **Equations:** include **no more than two absolutely essential equations**. For each one:
         – State plainly what the equation does.
         – Break it into logical chunks and explain each part.
         – Provide the complete spoken representation.
         – Restate its conceptual meaning and why it matters.
       • **Figures / Tables:** verbally describe only one or two visuals that are critical to understanding the findings. Explain their purpose, contents, key pattern, and relevance. Round numbers and repeat the key figure.
       • Give brief spoken definitions the first time highly technical terms appear.
       • Remove all in-text citations, reference numbers, and the references section entirely. Mention prior work generically instead.
       • Emphasize important points through verbal repetition and cues such as “Pay special attention to this next concept…”.
       • Preserve scientific accuracy; modify only what is necessary for audio clarity.

    3. **Concluding Summary** – finish with a brief recap of the main findings, key implications, and the single most important takeaway. Repeat the core message once more for retention.

    **Formatting Rules (MANDATORY):**
    • Output must be a single continuous narration – **no speaker labels, stage directions, or dramatic elements**.
    • Do **not** include any section headers or titles. Do not use markdown formatting. Use plain text only.
    • Do **not** include a References section.
    • Strategic redundancy is encouraged; brevity is not required where it harms comprehension.
    • Keep original wording wherever it doesn’t hinder the listener’s understanding when spoken aloud.
