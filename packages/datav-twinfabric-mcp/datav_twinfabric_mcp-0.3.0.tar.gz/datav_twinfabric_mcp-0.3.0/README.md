# TwinFabric MCP

Python bridge for interacting with TwinFabric using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Setup

1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed
2. Install `uv` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

At this point, you can configure your MCP Client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf) to use the Unreal MCP Server as per the [Configuring your MCP Client](README.md#configuring-your-mcp-client).
