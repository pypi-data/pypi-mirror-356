# mssql-python

This is a new Python driver for Microsoft SQL Server currently in Alpha phase.

## Public Preview Release

We are making progress - The Public Preview of our driver is now available! This marks a significant milestone in our development journey. While we saw a few early adopters of our alpha release, we are introducing the following functionalities to support your applications in a more robust and reliable manner.

### What's Included:

- Everything from alpha
- macOS Support: The mssql-python driver now supports macOS on Intel as well as ARM-based systems, enabling seamless development on Apple Silicon (M-series) devices. This milestone strengthens our cross-platform capabilities—and we’re just getting started. Linux support is on the horizon!
- Connection Pooling: We've introduced a robust and configurable connection pooling system designed to significantly enhance performance and optimize resource utilization. This feature ensures more efficient management of database connections, especially under high-load scenarios. This feature is only available on Windows as of now.

### What's Next:

As we continue to develop and refine the driver, you can expect regular updates that will introduce new features, optimizations, and bug fixes. We encourage you to contribute, provide feedback and report any issues you encounter, as this will help us improve the driver for the final release.

### Stay Tuned:

We appreciate your interest and support in this project. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we work towards delivering a robust and fully-featured driver in coming months.
Thank you for being a part of our journey!
