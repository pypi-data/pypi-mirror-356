      "taskTitle": "Implement Guardrail Designer Sub-agent",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each guardrail type into its own sub-agent module, add detailed error handling for each validation step, and create a configuration system for guardrail customization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple integration points, complex logic for validation and policy generation, and requires robust testing and documentation. The high number of technical components and dependencies justifies a high complexity score and a recommendation for detailed subtask expansion."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create Evaluation Harness",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate the harness into distinct modules for code execution, result collection, and reporting. Add detailed logging and security checks for sandbox operations.",
      "reasoning": "Building a reliable evaluation harness requires handling code execution, result analysis, and security, but is less complex than core agent logic. The number of required features supports a moderate complexity score and a recommendation for thorough subtask breakdown."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Artifact Bundling System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the bundling process into file generation, dependency management, and validation phases. Add support for custom metadata and optional Git integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves structured file generation and dependency management, but is less technically challenging than agent logic or evaluation. The need for completeness and validation supports a moderate complexity score and detailed subtask expansion."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Cost and Trace Telemetry",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down telemetry into API integration, data collection, dashboard creation, and export functionality. Add detailed error handling and historical data management.",
      "reasoning": "Telemetry implementation requires integration with external APIs and data management, but is less complex than core logic. The need for accuracy and user feedback supports a moderate complexity score and thorough subtask breakdown."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Template and Pattern Library",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Organize the library by template type, implement versioning and search, and add support for user-defined templates and template mixing.",
      "reasoning": "Template library creation involves data organization and search logic, but is less complex than agent logic or evaluation. The need for flexibility and user customization supports a moderate complexity score and detailed subtask expansion."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Diagram Generation and UX Enhancements",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate diagram generation, CLI output, and interactive features into distinct modules. Add detailed error handling and user feedback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on user experience and visualization, which is less technically complex than core logic or evaluation. The need for robustness and user interaction supports a moderate complexity score and thorough subtask breakdown."
