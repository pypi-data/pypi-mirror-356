        # If the container exits immediately because meta-agent prints help and exits,
        # you might need to make it sleep or run a long-lived command.
        # For example, to keep it running:
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
        # Then you would 'kubectl exec' into it and run 'meta-agent' manually.
        # If meta-agent itself can idle or has an interactive mode started by just 'meta-agent',
        # then you might not need the sleep command.
        # The current Dockerfile entrypoint is 'meta-agent', which prints help and exits.
        # So, 'sleep infinity' is likely needed to keep the pod running for 'exec'.
      # If your k3d cluster uses a different architecture (e.g. arm64 vs amd64 for the image)
      # you might need to specify node selectors or ensure your image is multi-arch.
