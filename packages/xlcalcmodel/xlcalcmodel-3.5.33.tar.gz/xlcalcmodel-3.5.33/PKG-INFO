# xlcalcmodel

**xlcalcmodel** is a high-performance, Python-based engine that transforms an Excel workbook into a dynamic, tokenized JSON model—essentially converting the spreadsheet into a set of rules. The process begins by loading an XLSX file and parsing all its formulas into tokens and abstract syntax trees (ASTs), capturing not only the formulas but also the cell dependencies and structure. This tokenized JSON model serves as a lightweight, memory-efficient representation of the original workbook.

Once parsed, the engine executes the model in a rules engine–style fashion. It compiles the tokenized formulas and then evaluates them, closely emulating Microsoft Excel’s behavior—including support for iterative and circular calculations—without ever needing an Excel installation or COM Automation. This design not only mirrors Excel’s computational logic but also makes complex spreadsheet calculations scalable and adaptable for server-side or headless applications.

In summary, xlcalcmodel takes the familiar world of Excel, disassembles it into a structured, tokenized JSON format, and then reassembles and executes that logic via a robust, extensible rules engine—delivering Excel-like computations in a high-performance, standalone Python environment.

## Overview

The **xlcalcmodel** library is a high-performance, Python-based Excel calculation engine that transforms Excel workbooks into tokenized, JSON-based models for rapid, standalone computation. It achieves this by converting spreadsheet formulas into refined abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and executing them in a rules-engine fashion that faithfully mimics Microsoft Excel. Key features include:

- A **sophisticated AST parser** that efficiently tokenizes and parses complex Excel formulas, laying the foundation for accurate and high-speed evaluations.
- Comprehensive support for a **broad spectrum of Excel functions**—including statistical, text, mathematical, logical, financial, engineering, date/time, and information functions—ensuring that nearly every native Excel capability is replicated.
- Complete handling of Excel-style cell references, encompassing absolute references (e.g. $A$1), range references (e.g. A1:B2), and even multi-sheet references, so that the spatial relationships within spreadsheets are preserved.
- Advanced processing of **array formulas and multi-cell ranges**, enabling efficient evaluation of vectorized operations and matrix-based calculations.
- Configurable **iterative calculation support** that mirrors Excel’s “Enable Iterative Calculation” option, allowing for convergence in workbooks with circular references.
- **Optimized memory efficiency** through custom, NumPy-backed Array types and a streamlined AST, minimizing overhead while maximizing performance.

## Key Features

### Extensive Function Support

xlcalcmodel implements a massive list of Excel functions, including (but not limited to):

- **Mathematical Functions:** `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `MOD`, `ROUND`, `ROUNDUP`, `ROUNDDOWN`, `POWER`, `SQRT`, `LN`, `LOG`, `EXP`, and more.
- **Logical Functions:** `IF`, `IFERROR`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, etc.
- **Text Functions:** `CONCAT`, `CONCATENATE`, `EXACT`, `FIND`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `LEN`, `LOWER`, `UPPER`, `TRIM`, etc.
- **Lookup Functions:** `VLOOKUP`, `MATCH`, `CHOOSE`, and others.
- **Financial Functions:** `NPV`, `IRR`, `PMT`, `PV`, `SLN`, `VDB`, `XIRR`, `XNPV`, etc.
- **Engineering Functions:** Base conversion functions such as `DEC2BIN`, `DEC2HEX`, `BIN2DEC`, etc.
- **Date & Time Functions:** `DATE`, `DATEDIF`, `DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`, `NOW`, `TODAY`, `WEEKDAY`, `EDATE`, `EOMONTH`, and more.
- **Information Functions:** `ISBLANK`, `ISNUMBER`, `ISTEXT`, `ISERROR`, `ISERR`, `ISNA`, `ISODD`, `ISEVEN`, `ISBOOLEAN`
> **Advanced Functionality:**
> In addition to the standard Excel function set, xlcalcmodel offers advanced support for several specialized functions:
> - `MROUND` Implements rounding of numbers to the nearest multiple, handling absolute references and error scenarios robustly.  
> - `N` Converts values to numbers following Excel’s conventions—including support for error propagation and array inputs—ensuring that even non-numeric types are processed as Excel does.

### Excel-Style Cell and Range Handling

- **Absolute and Relative References:**  
  The library fully supports Excel’s syntax for cell references—including absolute references (`$A$1`), relative references, and mixed references. Sheet names can be included in the reference, and ranges are parsed accurately.
  
- **Iterative Calculation Support:**  
  For workbooks that require iterative calculations, xlcalcmodel can be configured (e.g., setting the maximum iteration count to 100) to mimic Excel’s iterative behavior.
  
### Advanced Parsing and AST Generation

- **Robust Tokenization:**  
  A comprehensive regular expression-based tokenizer handles cell references, ranges, operators (including support for the exponentiation operator `^`), and function names with high accuracy.
  
- **Refined AST Parser:**  
  The parser builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the formula. It implements operator precedence (with dedicated levels for addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, exponentiation, unary, etc.) and ensures efficient evaluation.

- **Performance Optimizations:**  
  By converting plain Python lists to a custom, NumPy-backed `Array` type and performing minimal re-parsing (e.g., using a compiled AST), xlcalcmodel is designed to deliver efficient memory use and fast calculation speeds.

### Dependency Graph Overview

When you load or build a workbook, each cell formula is parsed into an Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST). The function `extract_references_from_ast` recursively walks
these AST nodes to gather every referenced cell. It handles individual
references (`A1`, `Sheet2!B5`), ranges, and function arguments, returning each
cell in canonical form (e.g., `Sheet1!A1`) with dollar signs stripped.

During `Model.build_dependency_graph()` this function is invoked for every
formula:

```python
self.dependency_graph.clear()
...
refs = extract_references_from_ast(cell_obj.parsed_ast, self, sheet_name)
self.dependency_graph[this_canonical] = list(refs)
```

The resulting `dependency_graph` maps each cell to the list of cells it depends
on. A companion `reverse_dependency_graph` is then derived for quick "who
depends on me?" lookups:

```python
from .dependency import build_reverse_dependency_graph
self.reverse_dependency_graph = build_reverse_dependency_graph(self)
```

By persisting these graphs with the model, xlcalcmodel can efficiently
recalculate only the affected cells when a value changes, or detect cycles for
iterative recalculations. This approach keeps dependency analysis lightweight
and enables fast incremental updates without re-parsing formulas.

### Compiled Formula Functions

Model.build_code() converts each parsed AST into a Python function. The compiler attaches the resulting callable to `cell.compiled_func`:

```python
def build_code(self):
    parser = FormulaParser()
    from .compiler import compile_cell
    for sheet_name, sheet_obj in self.sheets.items():
        for local_key, cell_obj in sheet_obj.cells.items():
            if cell_obj.formula:
                ast_result = parser.parse(cell_obj.formula)
                cell_obj.parsed_ast = ast_result
                compile_cell(cell_obj, self)
```

`EvalContext.eval_cell_value` then invokes this precompiled function whenever it is available:

```python
# Evaluate formula using compiled function when available
if getattr(cell, 'compiled_func', None):
    val = cell.compiled_func(self)
else:
    ...
```

Using precompiled functions avoids repeated AST traversal and makes recalculation significantly faster.

### Model Persistence

For even faster reload times, persist the model is compressed to a
pickle file after it is built:

```python
model.persist_to_pickle_file("model.pkl.gz")
restored = Model.construct_from_pickle_file("model.pkl.gz", build_code=False)
```
