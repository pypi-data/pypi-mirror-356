Hides vendor pricelist from non purchase users.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When an organization wants to hide their operational costs (for example,
by installing ``product_cost_security``), it is very likely that they
don't want regular users seeing the vendor prices as well, as they can
reveal the business margins.

This is meant for very low rank users (stock, website editors, etc...)

Usage
=====

Only users with purchase permission will be a able to see the vendor
pricelists from the products form.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This module only hides the supplierinfo but doesn't implement full
  security rules. That would be way more complicated. For the moment,
  this approach can be enough for most of the cases.
