# rubin-lc-simulator
A lightweight Python package for simulating time-domain light curves with Rubin/LSST cadence and photometric uncertainty. Supports sky-position-dependent cadence extraction via rubin_sim, customizable light curve injection using the LSST Camera's six optical filters (ugrizy), and realistic noise modeling based on Rubinâ€™s five sigma depth.

# Installation
The latest version can be installed via pip

```
    $ pip install rubin-lc-simulator
```

While the code requires only numpy, it is wrapped around the [rubin_sim API.](https://rubin-sim.lsst.io/)

This must be installed manually, please follow the instructions on their documentation.
