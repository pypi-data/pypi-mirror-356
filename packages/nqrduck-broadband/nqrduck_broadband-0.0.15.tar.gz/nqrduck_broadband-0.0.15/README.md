# NQRduck Module: nqrduck-broadband

A module for the [nqrduck](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/nqrduck) project. This module is used for broadband magnetic resonance experiments.

Tuning and Matching is done using the [ATM-system](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/ATM) in combination with the [nqrduck-autotm](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/nqrduck-autotm) module.

For mechanically tunable probe coils stepper motors for Tuning and Matching are used. 
For electrically tunable probe coils varactor diodes are used. The system is able to output a Tuning and Matching voltage in a range from 0 to 5V.

## Installation

### Requirements
Dependencies are handled via the pyproject.toml file.

### Setup
To install the module you need the NQRduck core. You can find the installation instructions for the NQRduck core [here](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/nqrduck).

Ideally you should install the module in a virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python -m venv nqrduck
# Activate the virtual environment
. nqrduck/bin/activate
```

You can install this module and the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal while the virtual environment is activated and you are in the root directory of this module:
```bash
pip install .
```
Alternatively, you can install the module and the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal while the virtual environment is activated:
```bash
pip install nqrduck-broadband
```

## Usage
The module is used with the [ATM-system](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/ATM) in combination with the [nqrduck-autotm](https://git.private.coffee/nqrduck/nqrduck-autotm) module. 

Depending on what kind of probe coil is used you can generate a Lookup Table for a certain frequency range using the 'Tuning and Matching' tab.
If you are using a low Q broadband probe coil you don't have to generate a Lookup Table.

The pulse sequence and spectrometer settings can be adjusted using the 'Spectrometer' tab.

- a.) The measurements settings with the frequency range and the number of steps. These settings are locked when generating a Lookup Table.
- b.) The information about the active Lookup Table.
- c.) The 'Broadband Plot'. Here the measured data is displayed. The plot is separated into the full broadband magnitude plot, the last time domain plot and the last frequency domain plot.
- d.) The 'Info Box'. Here information about the current status of the broadband measurement is displayed.



### Notes
- The active user needs to be in the correct group to use serial ports for the ATM-system. For example 'uucp' in Arch Linux and 'dialout' in Ubuntu.
