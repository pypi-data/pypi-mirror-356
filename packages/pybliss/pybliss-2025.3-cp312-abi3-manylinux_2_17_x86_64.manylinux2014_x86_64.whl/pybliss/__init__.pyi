        .. attribute:: shs_f

          First non-unit cell. Very fast but may result in large search

        .. attribute:: shs_fs

          First smallest non-unit cell. Fast, should usually produce smaller

          First largest non-unit cell. Fast, should usually produce smaller
          search spaces than shs_f.

          First maximally non-trivially connected non-unit cell. Not so
