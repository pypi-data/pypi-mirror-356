# Writing python docstrings

Always follow these rules when writing Python docstrings

1. Read and understand the entire function or class before writing the docstring
2. Always use Google format docstrings
3. Always include Types with arguments
4. Do not document return when nothing is returned
5. Only write in imperative voice. No Exceptions! 
6. Never say "This function ..." Only use imperative voice.
7. Docstrings should always be descriptive and explain why a developer would use the function, not just what it does
8, Do not use line wraps and newlines within paragraphs.
9. Do not included raised exceptions unless they are explicitly raised in the code

## Examples of good python docstrings

```python
def read_config(path: Path = "config.toml", globs:list[str] | None = None) -> list[Path]:
    """Read and validate the TOML configuration file that maps repository names to paths.

    Search the given `path` for files matching any of the glob patterns provided in `globs`. If no globs are provided, returns all files in the directory.
    
    Args:
        path (Path): The root directory where the search will be conducted.
        globs (list[str] | None, optional): A list of glob patterns to match files (e.g., "*.txt", "*.py"). If None, returns all files. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        list[Path]: A list of Path objects representing the files that match the glob patterns.

    Raises:
        cappa.Exit: If the config file doesn't exist, contains invalid TOML, or has invalid repository paths
    """
    ...
```
