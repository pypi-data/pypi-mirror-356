# 🍋 MangoAPI

**MangoAPI** is a lightweight meta-framework that lets you build modern, clean and asynchronous APIs inside a traditional Django project.

It integrates [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) for async routing, while preserving Django’s admin, ORM, and all core functionality.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Clean sintaxis.
- Powered by Starlette for async support.
- Fully compatible with Django admin, ORM, and views.
- Minimal and zero-boilerplate setup.

---

## 🔧 Django Integration

* Your Django project continues to work as usual (`/admin`, ORM, templates).
* Async routes are automatically mounted under `/api`.

---

## 🎯 Why MangoAPI?

Because you want the best of both worlds:

* Django’s power and ecosystem.
* The speed and modernity of async APIs.
