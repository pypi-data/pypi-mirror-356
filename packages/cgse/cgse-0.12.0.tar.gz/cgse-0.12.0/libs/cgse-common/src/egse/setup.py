# Setup

This module defines the Setup, which contains the complete configuration information for a test.

The Setup class contains all configuration items that are specific for a test or observation
and is normally (during nominal operation/testing) loaded automatically from the configuration
manager. The Setup includes type and identification of hardware that is used, calibration files,
software versions, reference frames and coordinate systems that link positions of alignment
equipment, conversion functions for temperature sensors, etc.

The configuration information that is in the Setup can be navigated in two different ways. First,
the Setup is a dictionary, so all information can be accessed by keys as in the following example.

    >>> setup = Setup({"gse": {"hexapod": {"ID": 42, "calibration": [0,1,2,3,4,5]}}})
    >>> setup["gse"]["hexapod"]["ID"]
    42

Second, each of the _keys_ is also available as an attribute of the Setup and that make it
possible to navigate the Setup with dot-notation:

    >>> id = setup.gse.hexapod.ID

In the above example you can see how to navigate from the setup to a device like the PUNA Hexapod.
The Hexapod device is connected to the control server and accepts commands as usual. If you want to
know which keys you can use to navigate the Setup, use the `keys()` method.

    >>> setup.gse.hexapod.keys()
    dict_keys(['ID', 'calibration'])
    >>> setup.gse.hexapod.calibration
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

To get a full printout of the Setup, you can use the `pretty_str()` method. Be careful, because
this can print out a lot of information when a full Setup is loaded.

    >>> print(setup)
    Setup
    └── gse
        └── hexapod
            ├── ID: 42
            └── calibration: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

### Special Values

Some of the information in the Setup is interpreted in a special way, i.e. some values are
processed before returning. Examples are the device classes and calibration/data files. The
following values are treated special if they start with:

* `class//`: instantiate the class and return the object
* `factory//`: instantiates a factory and executes its `create()` method
* `csv//`: load the CSV file and return a numpy array
* `yaml//`: load the YAML file and return a dictionary
* `pandas//`: load a CSV file into a pandas Dataframe
* `int-enum//`: dynamically create the enumeration and return the Enum object

#### Device Classes

Most of the hardware components in the Setup will have a `device` key that defines the class for
the device controller. The `device` keys have a value that starts with `class//` and it will
return the device object. As an example, the following defines the Hexapod device:

    >>> setup = Setup(
    ...   {
    ...     "gse": {
    ...       "hexapod": {"ID": 42, "device": "class//egse.hexapod.symetrie.puna.PunaSimulator"}
    ...     }
    ...   }
    ... )
    >>> setup.gse.hexapod.device.is_homing_done()
    False
    >>> setup.gse.hexapod.device.info()
    'Info about the PunaSimulator...'

In the above example you see that we can call the `is_homing_done()` and `info()` methodes
directly on the device by navigating the Setup. It would however be better (more performant) to
put the device object in a variable and work with that variable:

    >>> hexapod = setup.gse.hexapod.device
    >>> hexapod.homing()
    >>> hexapod.is_homing_done()
    True
    >>> hexapod.get_user_positions()

If you need, for some reason, to have access to the actual raw value of the hexapod device key,
use the `get_raw_value()` method:

    >>> setup.gse.hexapod.get_raw_value("device")
    <egse.hexapod.symetrie.puna.PunaSimulator object at ...

#### Data Files

Some information is too large to add to the Setup as such and should be loaded from a data file.
Examples are calibration files, flat-fields, temperature conversion curves, etc.

The Setup will automatically load the file when you access a key that contains a value that
starts with `csv//` or `yaml//`.

    >>> setup = Setup({
    ...     "instrument": {"coeff": "csv//cal_coeff_1234.csv"}
    ... })
    >>> setup.instrument.coeff[0, 4]
    5.0

Note: the resource location is always relative to the path defined by the *PROJECT*_CONF_DATA_LOCATION
environment variable.

The Setup inherits from a NavigableDict (aka navdict) which is also defined in this module.
