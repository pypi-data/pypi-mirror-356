# Pytorch-Numba Extension JIT

Writing custom CUDA operators in C and CPP can make certain operations significantly
more efficient, but requires setting up a full C++ project and involves a great deal of
boilerplate.
Writing CUDA kernels using `numba-cuda` is significantly easier, but incurs overhead on
every call, and still requires some boilerplate to integrate with the tracing systems
that underlie `torch.compile`.

However, many of the CUDA kernels that would be used for deep learning are relatively
similar (read from a set of input arrays, write to output arrays).
As such, most of the boilerplate and binding code for C++ extensions
could be generated automatically.

This project aims to do exactly that: `pnex.jit` takes a Python function in the form of a Numba CUDA
kernel, along with some type annotations, and compiles a user-friendly and
highly-performant PyTorch C++ extension.

Additionally, if a convenient wrapper for PyTorch Custom Operators is all that is desired,
this library also allows skipping the C++ compilation phase and only generating the
boilerplate for a Custom Operator definition.

For an example usage of this package, see my other
package [pytorch-nd-semiconv](https://p-adema.github.io/quadratic-conv/pytorch-nd-semiconv/docs.html)
