Here's a ""Hello, World!"" program in Python that is written in a very unpythonic way:

            print(x)

```

To run this program, you would need to:

1. Save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program using the Java compiler with the command: `javac HelloWorld.java`
4. Run the compiled program with the command: `java HelloWorld`

This will output `Hello, World!` to the console.",{'model': 'gpt-4o'},gpt-4o,Write hello world in Java
