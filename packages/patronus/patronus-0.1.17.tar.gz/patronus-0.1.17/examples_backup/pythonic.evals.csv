However, I can provide a few minor enhancements and clarifications to ensure clarity and completeness:

1. **File Naming**: Ensure that the file name matches the class name exactly, including case sensitivity.
2. **Comments**: Adding comments can help explain the code for beginners.
3. **Java Version**: Mentioning the Java version can be helpful, especially if there are specific features or syntax that may vary.

Hereâ€™s the revised version of your code with comments:

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    // The main method is the entry point of any Java application
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print ""Hello, World!"" to the console
        System.out.println(""Hello, World!"");
    }
}
```

### Instructions to Run the Program:

1. **Save the Code**: Save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`.
2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Access your terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows).
3. **Navigate to Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. **Compile the Program**: Run the following command to compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```
5. **Run the Compiled Program**: Execute the compiled program with the command:
   ```bash
   java HelloWorld
   ```

### Expected Output:
You should see the following output in your terminal:
```
Hello, World!
```
