# Operator Inference in Python

This package is a Python implementation of the Operator Inference framework for learning projection-based polynomial reduced-order models of dynamical systems.
The procedure is **data-driven** and **non-intrusive**, making it a viable candidate for model reduction of "glass-box" systems.
The methodology was [introduced in 2016 by Peherstorfer and Willcox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782516301104).

[**See the Documentation Here**](https://willcox-research-group.github.io/rom-operator-inference-Python3/).
