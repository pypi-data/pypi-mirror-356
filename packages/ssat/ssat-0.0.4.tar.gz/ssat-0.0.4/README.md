SSAT is a comprehensive Python package for statistical sports analysis, providing both frequentist and Bayesian statistical models for analyzing and predicting sports match outcomes. The package is particularly focused on handball but can be adapted for other sports.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Statistical Models

- **Frequentist Models**: Bradley-Terry, GSSD, TOOR, ZSD, PRP, Poisson
- **Bayesian Models**: Poisson, Negative Binomial, Skellam variants with MCMC sampling
- **Model Comparison**: Built-in tools for comparing predictions across different approaches

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Team Ratings**: Detailed offensive/defensive capabilities analysis
- **Match Prediction**: Win/Draw/Loss probabilities with uncertainty quantification
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive model benchmarking and validation
- **Visualization**: Rich plotting utilities for model diagnostics and team analysis

### Data Integration

- **Sample Data**: Included handball datasets for immediate experimentation
- **Flexible Input**: Support for various data formats and structures

## üì¶ Installation

### Installation

```bash
pip install ssat
```

### `cmdStan` Intallation

To use the Bayesian models you will need to install `cmdStan` as described in the [`cmdStan` Installation Guide](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanpy/installation.html#cmdstan-installation).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Frequentist Models Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from ssat.data import get_sample_handball_match_data
from ssat.frequentist import GSSD, BradleyTerry

# Load sample data
df = get_sample_handball_match_data()
league = "Starligue"
season = 2024
match_df = df.loc[(df["league"] == league) & (df["season"] == season)]

# Prepare data
X = match_df[["home_team", "away_team"]]
y = match_df["home_goals"] - match_df["away_goals"]  # spread
Z = match_df[["home_goals", "away_goals"]]

# Train-test split
train_size = int(len(match_df) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]
Z_train, Z_test = Z[:train_size], Z[train_size:]

# Fit models
bt_model = BradleyTerry()
bt_model.fit(X_train, y_train, Z_train)

gssd_model = GSSD()
gssd_model.fit(X_train, y_train, Z_train)

# Make predictions
test_fixtures = X_test.apply(lambda x: f"{x.home_team}-{x.away_team}", axis=1)

bt_probas = bt_model.predict_proba(X_test, point_spread=0, include_draw=True)
gssd_probas = gssd_model.predict_proba(X_test, point_spread=0, include_draw=True)

bt_probas_df = pd.DataFrame(
    bt_probas, columns=["Home", "Draw", "Away"], index=test_fixtures
)
gssd_probas_df = pd.DataFrame(
    gssd_probas, columns=["Home", "Draw", "Away"], index=test_fixtures
)
print(bt_probas_df.head())
print(gssd_probas_df.head())

# Get team ratings
bt_team_ratings = bt_model.get_team_ratings()
print(bt_team_ratings.head())

gssd_team_ratings = gssd_model.get_team_ratings()
print(gssd_team_ratings.head())
```

### Bayesian Models Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from ssat.bayesian import Poisson, Skellam
from ssat.data import get_sample_handball_match_data

# Load sample data
df = get_sample_handball_match_data()
league = "Starligue"
season = 2024
match_df = df.loc[(df["league"] == league) & (df["season"] == season)]

# Prepare data
X = match_df[["home_team", "away_team", "home_goals", "away_goals"]]
X = X.assign(goal_diff=X["home_goals"] - X["away_goals"])

# Train-test split
train_size = int(len(match_df) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]

# Fit Bayesian models
poisson_model = Poisson()
poisson_model.fit(X_train, seed=42)

skellam_model = Skellam()
skellam_model.fit(X_train[["home_team", "away_team", "goal_diff"]], seed=42)

# Visualize model diagnostics
poisson_model.plot_trace()
poisson_model.plot_team_stats()

skellam_model.plot_trace()
skellam_model.plot_team_stats()

# Make predictions on new matches
test_fixtures = X_test.apply(lambda x: f"{x.home_team}-{x.away_team}", axis=1)

poisson_preds = poisson_model.predict(X_test)
poisson_probas = poisson_model.predict_proba(X_test)
poisson_probas.index = test_fixtures

skellam_preds = skellam_model.predict(X_test)
skellam_probas = skellam_model.predict_proba(X_test)
skellam_probas.index = test_fixtures

# Print results - notice how the Skellam assign a higher probability to draws
print(poisson_probas.head())
print(skellam_probas.head())
```

match_df = df.loc[(df["league"] == league) & (df["season"] == season)]

# Prepare data
X = match_df[["home_team", "away_team"]]
y = match_df["home_goals"] - match_df["away_goals"]  # spread
Z = match_df[["home_goals", "away_goals"]]

# Train-test split
train_size = int(len(match_df) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]
Z_train, Z_test = Z[:train_size], Z[train_size:]

# Compare multiple models
models = [BradleyTerry(), GSSD()]
results = {}

for model in models:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, Z_train)
    preds = model.predict(X_test)
    results[model.NAME] = np.mean(np.abs(preds - y_test))

print("Model Performance (MAE):")
for model_name, mae in results.items():
    print(f"{model_name}: {mae:.3f}")
```

### Custom Team Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
from ssat.data import get_sample_handball_match_data
from ssat.frequentist import BradleyTerry, GSSD

# Load sample data
df = get_sample_handball_match_data()
league = "Starligue"
season = 2024
match_df = df.loc[(df["league"] == league) & (df["season"] == season)]


# Prepare data
X = match_df[["home_team", "away_team"]]
y = match_df["home_goals"] - match_df["away_goals"]  # spread
Z = match_df[["home_goals", "away_goals"]]

# Train-test split
train_size = int(len(match_df) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]
Z_train, Z_test = Z[:train_size], Z[train_size:]

# Fit Model
gssd_model = GSSD()
gssd_model.fit(X_train, y_train, Z_train)

# Detailed team strength analysis
team_stats = gssd_model.get_team_ratings()
print("Team Offensive/Defensive Breakdown:")
print(team_stats[['pfh', 'pah', 'pfa', 'paa']].head())

# Model coefficients
coeffs = team_stats.loc['Coefficients']
print(f"Home offense coefficient: {coeffs['pfh']:.3f}")
print(f"Home defense coefficient: {coeffs['pah']:.3f}")
```

## üìä Data Format

SSAT expects data in the following format:

```python
# Required columns for match data
match_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'home_team': ['Team A', 'Team B', ...],
    'away_team': ['Team B', 'Team C', ...],
    'home_goals': [25, 30, ...],
    'away_goals': [23, 28, ...],
})
```
