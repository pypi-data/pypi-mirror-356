    Acknowledgement handles the acknowledgment of a message, ensuring it is processed successfully or marked as failed.

    This class is designed to encapsulate the logic of acknowledging or negatively acknowledging
    a message, while also keeping track of whether the message has already been acknowledged.
    It provides methods to explicitly acknowledge (ack) or negatively acknowledge (nack) a message.
    Additionally, it allows checking the acknowledgment status via a property.
