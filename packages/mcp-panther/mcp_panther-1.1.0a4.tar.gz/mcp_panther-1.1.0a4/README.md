Panther's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides functionality to:
1. **Write and tune detections from your IDE**
2. **Interactively query security logs using natural language**
3. **Triage, comment, and resolve one or many alerts**

## Security Best Practices

Panther highly recommends the following MCP best practices:

- **Run only trusted, officially signed MCP servers.** Verify digital signatures or checksums before running, audit the tool code, and avoid community tools from unofficial publishers.
- **Apply strict least-privilege to Panther API tokens.** Scope tokens to the minimal permissions required and bind them to an IP allow-list or CIDR range so they're useless if exfiltrated. Rotate credentials on a preferred interval (e.g., every 30d).
- **Host the MCP server in a locked-down sandbox (e.g., Docker) with read-only mounts.** This confines any compromise to a minimal blast radius.
- **Monitor credential access to Panther and monitor for anomalies.** Write a Panther rule!
- **Scan MCP servers with `mcp-scan`.** Utilize the `mcp-scan` tool by [invariantlabs](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) for common vulnerabilities.

## Panther Configuration

1. Create an API token in Panther:
   - Navigate to Settings (gear icon) â†’ API Tokens
   - Create a new token with the following permissions (recommended read-only approach to start):
   - <details>
     <summary><strong>View Required Permissions</strong></summary>

     ![Screenshot of Panther Token permissions](.github/panther-token-perms-2.png)

     </details>

2. Store the generated token securely (e.g., in 1Password)

3. Grab the Panther instance URL from your browser (e.g., `https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain`)
    - Note: This must include `https://`

## MCP Installation

**Choose one of the following installation methods:**

### Docker Setup (Recommended)
The easiest way to get started is using our pre-built Docker image:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-e", "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL",
        "-e", "PANTHER_API_TOKEN",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/panther-labs/mcp-panther"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### UVX Setup
For Python users, you can run directly from PyPI using uvx:

1. [Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Configure your MCP client:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-panther"],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Client Setup

### Cursor
[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers) to configure your project or global MCP configuration. **It's VERY IMPORTANT that you do not check this file into version control.**

Once configured, navigate to Cursor Settings > MCP to view the running server:

<img src=".github/panther-mcp-cursor-config.png" width="500" />

**Tips:**
* Be specific about where you want to generate new rules by using the `@` symbol and then typing a specific directory.
* For more reliability during tool use, try selecting a specific model, like Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
* If your MCP Client is failing to find any tools from the Panther MCP Server, try restarting the Client and ensuring the MCP server is running. In Cursor, refresh the MCP Server and start a new chat.

### Claude Desktop
To use with Claude Desktop, manually configure your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

1. Open the Claude Desktop settings and navigate to the Developer tab
2. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-panther": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-panther"],
      "env": {
        "PANTHER_INSTANCE_URL": "https://YOUR-PANTHER-INSTANCE.domain",
        "PANTHER_API_TOKEN": "YOUR-PANTHER-API-TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

If you run into any issues, [try the troubleshooting steps here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user#troubleshooting).

### Goose
Use with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), Block's open-source AI agent:
```bash
# Start Goose with the MCP server
goose session --with-extension "uvx mcp-panther"
```

## Troubleshooting

Check the server logs for detailed error messages: `tail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`. Common issues and solutions are listed below.

### Running tools

- If you get a `{"success": false, "message": "Failed to [action]: Request failed (HTTP 403): {\"error\": \"forbidden\"}"}` error, it likely means your API token lacks the particular permission needed by the tool.
- Ensure your Panther Instance URL is correctly set. You can view this in the `config://panther` resource from your MCP Client.
