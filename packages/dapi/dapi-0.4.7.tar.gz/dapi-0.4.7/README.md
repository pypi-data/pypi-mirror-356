`dapi` is a library that simplifies the process of submitting, running, and monitoring [TAPIS v3](https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) jobs on [DesignSafe](https://designsafe-ci.org) via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org).

## Features

### Jobs

* Get TAPIS v3 templates for jobs: No need to fiddle with complex API requests. `dapi` abstracts away the complexities.

* Seamless Integration with DesignSafe Jupyter Notebooks: Launch DesignSafe applications directly from the Jupyter environment.

### Database

Connects to SQL databases on DesignSafe:

| Database | dbname | env_prefix |
|----------|--------|------------|
| NGL | `ngl`| `NGL_` |
| Earthake Recovery | `eq` | `EQ_` |
| Vp | `vp` | `VP_` |

Define the following environment variables:
```
{env_prefix}DB_USER
{env_prefix}DB_PASSWORD
{env_prefix}DB_HOST
{env_prefix}DB_PORT
```

For e.g., to add the environment variable `NGL_DB_USER` edit `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or a similar shell-specific configuration file for the current user and add `export NGL_DB_USER="dspublic"`.


## Installation

Install `dapi` via pip

```shell
pip3 install dapi
```

To install the current development version of the library use:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/DesignSafe-CI/dapi.git --quiet
```

## Example usage:

### Storing credentials

Dapi uses the Tapis v3 SDK to authenticate with the DesignSafe API. To store your credentials, create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```shell
DESIGNSAFE_USERNAME=<your_designsafe_username>
DESIGNSAFE_PASSWORD=<your_designsafe_password>
```

### Jobs

* [Jupyter Notebook Templates](example-notebooks/template-mpm-run.ipynb) using dapi.

* View [dapi API doc](https://designsafe-ci.github.io/dapi/dapi/index.html)

On [DesignSafe Jupyter](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org/):

Install the latest version of `dapi` and restart the kernel (Kernel >> Restart Kernel):

```python
# Remove any previous installations
!pip uninstall dapi -y
# Install
!pip install dapi --quiet
```

* Import `dapi` library
```python
import dapi
```

* To list all functions in `dapi`
```python
dir(dapi)
```

### Database
```python
from dapi.db import DSDatabase

db = DSDatabase("ngl")
sql = 'SELECT * FROM SITE'
df = db.read_sql(sql)
print(df)

# Optionally, close the database connection when done
db.close()
```
