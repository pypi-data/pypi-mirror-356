## What Is PictureFrame?

This is a viewer for a raspberry powered picture frame. For remote control it provides an automatic integration into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) via MQTT discovery.

## History of PictureFrame

When I started 2019 my DIY project building a raspberry powered digital picture frame I came across Wolfgang's website [www.thedigitalpictureframe.com](https://www.thedigitalpictureframe.com/). I ran my frame with the [pi3d PictureFrame2020.py](https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos) viewer, but always missed a more deeply integration to my smart home server running [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).As my personel corona project I decided to rewrite the viewer to my needs. Hoping  someone can make use of it.
