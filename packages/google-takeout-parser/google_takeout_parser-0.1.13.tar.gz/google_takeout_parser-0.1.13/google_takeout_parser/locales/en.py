# Note: when I say 'no info here' or 'not useful', is just how the
# data appears in my export. It might be useful for you -- if so
# feel free to make a PR or an issue to parse it
#
# Can also extend or overwrite these functions by passing
# 'None' if you don't want a certain part to be parsed,
# or by passing your own function which parses the file something from models.py

# Reminder that dicts are ordered, so order here can matter
# If you want to parse one file from a folder with lot of files, can
# specify that file, and then on the next line specify 'None'
# for the folder, ignoring the rest of files

# Setting 'None' in the handler map specifies that we should ignore this file
