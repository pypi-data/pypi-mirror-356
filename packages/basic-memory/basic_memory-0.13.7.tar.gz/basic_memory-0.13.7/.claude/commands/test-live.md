# /project:test-live - Live Basic Memory Testing Suite

Execute comprehensive real-world testing of Basic Memory using the installed version, following the methodology in TESTING.md. All test results are recorded as notes in a dedicated test project.

## Usage
```
/project:test-live [phase]
```

**Parameters:**
- `phase` (optional): Specific test phase to run (`core`, `features`, `edge`, `workflows`, `stress`, or `all`)

## Implementation

You are an expert QA engineer conducting live testing of Basic Memory. 
When the user runs `/project:test-live`, execute comprehensive testing following the TESTING.md methodology:

### Pre-Test Setup

1. **Environment Verification**
   - Verify basic-memory is installed and accessible via MCP
   - Check version and confirm it's the expected release
   - Test MCP connection and tool availability

2. **Test Project Creation**

Run the bash `date` command to get the current date/time. 

   ```
   Create project: "basic-memory-testing-[timestamp]"
   Location: ~/basic-memory-testing-[timestamp]
   Purpose: Record all test observations and results
   ```

Make sure to switch to the newly created project with the `switch_project()` tool.

3. **Baseline Documentation**
   Create initial test session note with:
   - Test environment details
   - Version being tested
   - Test objectives and scope
   - Start timestamp

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Validation

Test all fundamental MCP tools systematically:

**write_note Tests:**

- Frontmatter handling (tags, custom fields)
- Special characters in titles and content
- Unicode and emoji support
- Empty notes and minimal content

**read_note Tests:**

- Non-existent notes (error handling)
- Notes with complex formatting
- Performance with large notes

**view_note Tests:**
- View notes as formatted artifacts (Claude Desktop)
- Title extraction from frontmatter and headings
- Unicode and emoji content in artifacts
- Error handling for non-existent notes
- Artifact display quality and readability

**search_notes Tests:**

### Phase 4: Real-World Workflow Scenarios

**Meeting Notes Pipeline:**
1. Create meeting notes with action items
2. Extract action items using edit_note
3. Build relations to project documents
4. Update progress incrementally
5. Search and track completion

**Research Knowledge Building:**
1. Create research topic hierarchy
2. Build complex relation networks
3. Add incremental findings over time
4. Search for connections and patterns
5. Reorganize as knowledge evolves

**Multi-Project Workflow:**
1. Technical documentation project
2. Personal recipe collection project
3. Learning/course notes project
4. Switch contexts during conversation
5. Cross-reference related concepts

**Content Evolution:**
1. Start with basic notes
2. Enhance with relations and observations
3. Reorganize file structure using moves
4. Update content with edit operations
5. Validate knowledge graph integrity

### Phase 5: Creative Stress Testing

**Creative Exploration:**
- Rapid project creation/switching patterns
- Unusual but valid markdown structures
- Creative observation categories
- Novel relation types and patterns
- Unexpected tool combinations

**Stress Scenarios:**
- Bulk operations (many notes quickly)
- Complex nested moves and edits
- Deep context building
- Complex boolean search expressions
- Resource constraint testing
