# Coffee Knowledge Base

A comprehensive collection of coffee knowledge, from bean origins to brewing methods to tasting notes. This knowledge base demonstrates Basic Memory's ability to organize and connect information in a meaningful way.

## Overview

This Coffee Knowledge Base captures key information about coffee, structured with semantic observations and relations that connect different aspects of coffee knowledge. It serves as both a useful reference for coffee enthusiasts and a demonstration of how Basic Memory organizes information.

## Key Topics

### Core Coffee Knowledge

- [[Coffee Brewing Methods]] - Different techniques for preparing coffee
- [[Coffee Bean Origins]] - Where coffee comes from and how region affects flavor
- [[Brewing Equipment]] - Tools and devices used to prepare coffee
- [[Flavor Extraction]] - The science of dissolving flavor compounds from coffee
- [[Tasting Notes]] - How to taste and describe coffee flavors

### Brewing Techniques

- Proper grinding is fundamental to good extraction
- Water quality significantly impacts flavor
- Different brewing methods highlight different characteristics
- Time, temperature, and grind size are the key variables to control
- Freshness of beans dramatically affects quality

### Coffee Preferences

- Light roasts preserve more origin characteristics and acidity
- Dark roasts emphasize body and chocolatey/roasted flavors
- Pour over methods highlight clarity and distinct flavor notes
- Immersion methods create fuller body and rounded flavor
- Personal preference matters more than "correctness"

## Using This Knowledge Base

### For Learning

Use this knowledge base to:
- Understand coffee fundamentals
- Explore connections between brewing methods and flavor outcomes
- Learn how different origins produce distinct flavor profiles
- Discover how equipment affects the brewing process
- Develop a vocabulary for describing coffee experiences

### As a Demo

This knowledge base demonstrates:
- Semantic knowledge organization with categories and relations
- Building connections between related concepts
- Creating a navigable knowledge graph
- Structuring information in a way both humans and AI assistants can understand
- How Basic Memory enables persistent knowledge across conversations
