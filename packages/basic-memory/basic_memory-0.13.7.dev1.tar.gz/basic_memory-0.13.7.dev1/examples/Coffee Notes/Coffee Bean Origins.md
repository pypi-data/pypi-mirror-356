# Coffee Bean Origins

An exploration of coffee-growing regions around the world and how geography, climate, and processing methods affect flavor profiles.

## Overview

Coffee beans are grown in various regions around the world, primarily in what's known as the "Coffee Belt" - the area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The flavor characteristics of coffee beans are influenced by:

- Geographic region and climate
- Altitude
- Soil composition
- Variety of coffee plant
- Processing method
- Harvest and sorting practices

## Observations

- [principle] Higher altitude generally produces harder, denser beans with more complex acidity #altitude
- [region] Ethiopian beans often feature bright, fruity notes with floral aromatics #ethiopia
- [region] Colombian coffee typically offers balanced acidity with caramel sweetness and nutty undertones #colombia
- [region] Guatemalan coffee presents complex acidity with chocolate notes and sometimes spice characteristics #guatemala
- [region] Brazilian coffee tends toward nutty, chocolate notes with lower acidity and fuller body #brazil
- [region] Kenyan coffee is known for bright, wine-like acidity and berry or citrus notes #kenya
- [processing] Natural (dry) processing tends to create fruitier, more fermented flavors #processing
- [processing] Washed (wet) processing generally results in cleaner, brighter cups with more clarity #processing
- [processing] Honey processing creates a middle ground with some fruity notes while maintaining clarity #processing
- [factor] Shade-grown coffee typically develops more slowly, resulting in more complex flavors #cultivation
- [factor] Soil volcanic soil often imparts distinctive mineral characteristics to coffee #terroir
- [variety] Gesha/Geisha variety is known for exceptional floral and tea-like qualities #varieties
- [variety] Bourbon varieties often feature sweet, complex cup profiles #varieties
- [variety] Robusta beans have higher caffeine content but generally less complex flavor than Arabica #varieties

## Major Growing Regions

- [africa] Ethiopian coffees: Yirgacheffe, Sidamo, Harrar regions each with distinctive profiles #ethiopia
- [africa] Kenyan coffees: Often categorized by grade (AA, AB, etc.) based on bean size #kenya
- [americas] Colombian regions: Huila, Nari√±o, Antioquia each with unique characteristics #colombia
- [americas] Central American producers: Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama known for balanced profiles #central_america
- [americas] Brazilian regions: Cerrado, Sul de Minas, Mogiana with varying profiles #brazil
- [asia] Indonesian islands: Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi producing earthy, full-bodied coffees #indonesia
- [asia] Vietnamese coffee: World's largest Robusta producer, often used in blends and commercial coffee #vietnam

## Processing Methods

- [natural] Beans dried inside the fruit, creating fruity, fermented notes and heavier body #processing
- [washed] Fruit removed before drying, resulting in cleaner cup with more pronounced acidity #processing
- [honey] Some fruit mucilage left on during drying, creates balanced sweetness and body #processing
- [wet-hulled] Unique to Indonesia, creates earthy, herbal, low-acid profiles #processing
- [experimental] Anaerobic fermentation, wine-yeast inoculation, and other newer methods #innovation

## Tasting Notes by Region

- [ethiopia] Blueberry, jasmine, bergamot, stone fruit, citrus #flavor_notes
- [kenya] Blackcurrant, tomato, tropical fruit, wine-like acidity #flavor_notes
- [colombia] Caramel, nuts, red apple, chocolate, balanced acidity #flavor_notes
- [guatemala] Chocolate, spice, green apple, balanced #flavor_notes
- [brazil] Nuts, chocolate, low acidity, full body #flavor_notes
- [indonesia] Earthy, herbal, spice, cedar, full body, low acidity #flavor_notes
