# productspy

A simple Python library to grab product info like name and price from popular shopping sites like Amazon, Noon, AliExpress, Carrefour, and Extra.


## What it does

- Pulls out the product name, price, and URL from product pages.
- Supports multiple sites using different ways (HTML parsing, JSON-LD, or Playwright for sites that load content with JavaScript).
- Manages cookies so it can get around some security stuff on sites like AliExpress.
- Super easy to use — just give it a product link, and it’ll give you the info.


## How to install 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```
## How to use
```bash
from productspy import get_product_info

url = "put your product URL here"
info = get_product_info(url)

print(f"Product Name: {info['name']}")
print(f"Price: {info['price']}")
print(f"URL: {info['url']}")
```
## Supported sites

- Amazon
- Noon
- AliExpress
- Carrefour
- Extra


## Cookies update (for AliExpress)
If cookies expire, the library will open a browser window so you can log in or verify yourself. Just follow the steps and close the browser when you’re done.
