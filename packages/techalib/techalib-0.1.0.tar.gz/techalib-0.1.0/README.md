## ðŸ¤“ Contribution

To contribute to the techalib project, first fork the repository and create a new branch from upstream/main using a proper naming convention (feat/, fix/, etc.). Set up your development environment by installing Python, Rust, and project dependencies, then build the project and run tests. If you're adding a new indicator, use the provided tools to generate boilerplate code and test data, and follow the inserted TODO comments. Follow the commit message guidelines and rebase your branch onto the latest changes from upstream/main. Finally, open a pull request with a clear description, allow edits by maintainers, and be ready to respond to review feedback.

For a more detailed description please read this [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.
