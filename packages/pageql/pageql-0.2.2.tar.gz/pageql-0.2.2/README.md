PageQL is a template / application language / micro python web framework that allows embedding SQL inside HTML directly.

It was inspired by ColdFusion language that allows embedding SQL and Handlebars / Mustache logic-less templates and also HTMX that simplifies web development

PageQL is **reactive-first**: rendered HTML automatically updates when the underlying database data changes.

Usage: ```pageql templates <database> [--create] [--test]```

Install: pip install pageql  # uvicorn[standard] is installed automatically

## Benchmarking

Basic performance tests can be executed using the standalone script in
`benchmarks/benchmark_pageql.py`.  The script exercises 20 different
rendering features of PageQL using a temporary file based SQLite database.

Run it with the repository's `src` directory on the Python path so that the
`pageql` package can be imported:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/benchmark_pageql.py
```

## Core Philosophy

PageQL aims to simplify web development involving relational data by allowing direct embedding of SQL-like queries within HTML templates. It draws inspiration from ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) but focuses specifically on rendering reactive relational data.

**Key Principles:**

*   **Data-Centric:** The primary goal is displaying and manipulating data from a relational database. It is *not* intended as a full-fledged backend language.
*   **Declarative Focus:** While control structures (`#if`, potentially `#each`) exist, extensive scripting is discouraged to maintain clarity and focus on data presentation.
*   **Leverages SQL:** PageQL relies on the underlying SQL engine for expression evaluation, rather than implementing its own complex expression language.

## Reactive Queries

PageQL renders templates **reactively by default**. HTML output automatically updates whenever the underlying data used by a query (e.g., within a `#from` block) changes in the database.

This capability drives several core design choices:

*   **Declarative Nature:** Using declarative tags like `#from` helps the system understand the data dependencies of a template fragment.
*   **Minimal Scripting (`Logic-less`):** Limiting imperative scripting makes it feasible to analyze template dependencies statically and determine which data changes should trigger UI updates.
*   **Focus on SQL:** Leveraging the database allows integration with notification or change‑tracking mechanisms (e.g., triggers, event systems, logical replication) to power this reactivity.

By keeping templates focused on declaring *what* data is needed rather than *how* to fetch and update it imperatively, PageQL automatically reflects database changes in the rendered HTML with minimal developer effort.

## Design Choices & Simplifications

To maintain focus and simplicity, several design choices have been made:

*   **Simplified Imports/Rendering:** A single `#import` tag for modules and a single `#render` tag for partials/snippets provide a consistent mechanism for code reuse.
*   **Basic Error Handling:** On encountering an error, processing stops, and the error is written to a debug output (details TBD). There is no complex exception handling mechanism.
*   **Database-Driven State:** Communication and state management between requests should primarily occur via the database, not through internal application state or direct communication tags.
*   **External Extensibility:** Extensibility is planned via external APIs, not through mechanisms within the template language itself.

**Features explicitly *out of scope* (currently):**

*   Complex backend logic
*   Direct file management
*   Built-in form generation tags
*   Direct internet protocol tags (HTTP requests, etc.)
*   Advanced application framework features (handled externally)

## Usage (Preliminary)

PageQL is intended to be run via a command-line tool. The basic usage involves pointing the tool at a directory of `.pageql` files and specifying the SQLite database or a database URL to use.

```bash
pageql ./templates path/to/your/database.sqlite
```

*   `<path>`: (Required) Path to the directory containing the PageQL template files (`.pageql`) to be served.
*   `<database>`: (Required) Path to the SQLite database file or a PostgreSQL/MySQL connection URL.
*   `--port <number>`: (Optional) Port number to run the development server on. Defaults to a standard port (e.g., 8000 or 8080).
*   `-q, --quiet`: (Optional) Only output errors when running the server.
*   `--fallback-url <url>`: (Optional) Forward unknown routes to this base URL.
*   `--no-csrf`: (Optional) Disable CSRF protection. Useful for local testing but not recommended in production.
*   `--test`: (Optional) Run template tests and exit instead of serving.
*   `--http-disconnect-cleanup-timeout <seconds>`: (Optional) Delay before cleaning up HTTP disconnect contexts.
*   `--profile`: (Optional) Profile the server using `cProfile` and print statistics when it stops.
*   `--host <address>`: (Optional) Host interface to bind.
*   `--no-reload`: (Optional) Disable template auto-reloading.
*   `--create`: (Optional) Create SQLite DB if missing.
*   `--log-level <level>`: (Optional) Set log verbosity.
*   PageQL automatically configures new SQLite databases with write-ahead logging
    and an increased cache for better concurrency.
*   When a PostgreSQL or MySQL URL is provided, `--create` is ignored and the
    database must already exist.
*   Although `postgres://` and `mysql://` URLs work, remote connections add read
    latency that can degrade performance of reactive queries.

## Docker

A simple `Dockerfile` is included for running PageQL in a containerized
environment.  The image installs the package and by default serves templates
from the `/app/website` directory (you can mount a volume there) using a SQLite
database stored under `/data`.

```bash
docker build -t pageql .
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
    -v $(pwd)/website:/app/website \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
    pageql
```

The container runs `pageql /app/website /data/data.db --create --host 0.0.0.0` so
a new database is created automatically on first use and the server is
reachable from outside the container.

*(Note: Actual command name and argument flags are subject to change.)*

## Proposed Tag Syntax

**Database/Query:**

* (Note: All database modification tags (`#insert`, `#update`, `#delete`) executed within a single request lifecycle are typically treated as a single atomic transaction. Processing stops on the first error, and prior modifications within the same request are rolled back.)*
*   `#from <table> [WHERE ...] [ORDER BY ...]`: Executes a `SELECT` query against a table (or potentially a view) and iterates over the results. Supports binding parameters (e.g., `:limit`).
*  [NOT IMPLEMENTED]  `#view <name> from <table> [WHERE ...]`: Creates a reusable SQL view definition. Supports binding parameters (e.g., `:halfusers`).
*   `#insert into <table> [(col1, col2, ...)] values (val1, val2, ...)`: Executes an `INSERT` SQL command. The column list is optional if values are provided for all columns in order. Values (`val1`, `val2`, etc.) can be literals or bound parameters (e.g., `:form_field_name`).
*   `#update <table> set col1=val1, col2=val2, ... [WHERE ...]`: Executes an `UPDATE` SQL command. Values (`val1`, `val2`, etc.) can be literals or bound parameters.
*   `#delete from <table> [WHERE ...]`: Executes a `DELETE` SQL command. Supports binding parameters in the `WHERE` clause.
*   `#merge <sql>`: Executes an SQL `MERGE` statement.

**Partials/Modules:**

*   `#render [GET | POST | PUT | DELETE | PATCH] <partial> [param=value ...]`: Renders a partial (defined locally or imported). When calling a partial that is tied to a specific HTTP verb, that verb must appear directly after `#render`.
*   `#partial [public | GET | POST | PUT | DELETE | PATCH] <name>`: Defines a reusable partial block.
    *   **Public Access:** Using `public` (or specifying `GET`) makes the partial reachable via an HTTP GET request at `/<filename>/<partial_name>` (where `<filename>` is the template file name without the `.pageql` extension). Other verbs restrict access to that specific HTTP method.
    *   **Base File Access:** Requests to the base URL path corresponding to the file (`/<filename>`) render the *top-level content* outside any named `#partial` block.
    *   **Parameters:** For all public/verb-specific accesses, URL query parameters are available via the standard parameter binding mechanism (e.g., `:param_name`).
    *   **Example:** `{{#partial DELETE :id}}...{{/partial}}` can only be requested with an HTTP `DELETE` and must be rendered using `#render DELETE some_module/:id`.
*   `#import <module> [as <alias>]`: Imports modules relative to the template root directory, optionally assigning an alias. Assumes `.pageql` extension (e.g., `#import "components/button"` loads `components/button.pageql`).

**Variable Manipulation:**

*   `#let :<variable> = <expression> [from <table> [WHERE ...]]`: Sets a variable. The value can be a literal (string, integer, float, `NULL`), or the result of a SQL expression, optionally evaluated against a table with a `WHERE` clause.
*   `#param <name> [type=<type>] [optional | required] [default=<simple_expression>] [min=<num>] [max=<num>] [minlength=<num>] [maxlength=<num>] [pattern="<regex>"]`: Declares and optionally validates an expected request parameter (URL query string or POST form variable) named `<name>`.
    *   **Behavior:** Choose `optional` or `required`. **If neither is specified, the default is `required`.**
        *   `required` (or default): Processing stops with an error if the parameter is missing and no `default` is provided.
        *   `optional`: Parameter may be missing. If missing and no `default` is given, `:<name>`  set to `NULL` (instead of being undefined)
    *   `default=<simple_expression>`: Provides a default value if the parameter is missing from the request. If present, this prevents the `required` check from failing.
    *   **Validation:** Optional attributes (`type`, `min`/`max`, `minlength`/`maxlength`, `pattern`) enforce rules on the parameter's value (after applying the default, if applicable). If any validation fails, processing stops with an error.
    *   **Access:** The validated (and potentially defaulted) parameter value is made available as `:<name>`. Direct access via `:<name>` without this tag bypasses validation and defaults.
    *   Dots in `<name>` are converted to `__` when the parameter is looked up, so `#param cookies.session` binds the value of `cookies__session`.

*   `#fetch async <var> from <url_expression> [header=<expr>] [method=<expr>] [body=<expr>]`: Fetches an external URL in the background while rendering. `<var>.status_code`, `<var>.body`, and `<var>.headers` start as `NULL` but automatically update when the request completes. `header=` may be used multiple times to supply request headers as mappings or strings. The `method` expression chooses the HTTP verb (default `GET`). The `body` expression sends a request payload encoded as bytes if provided. Relative URLs require a `base_url` to be specified.

    ```pageql
    {{#fetch async horse from "https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/03/26/50/04/360_F_326500445_ZD1zFSz2cMT1qOOjDy7C5xCD4shawQfM.jpg"}}
        {{#if :horse.status_code == 200 }}
        <img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{{base64_encode(:horse.body)}}" alt="Horse">
        {{#else}}
          <p>Loading horse image...</p>
        {{/if}}
    {{/fetch}}
    ```

**Flow Control:**

*   `#if <expression>`: Conditional rendering based on an expression.
*   `#else`: Else condition within an `#if` block.
*   `#elif <expression>`: Else-if condition within an `#if` block.
*   `#ifdef <variable>`: Checks if a variable is defined
*   `#ifndef <variable>`: Checks if a variable is not defined
*   `#each <param>`: Iterate over sequential parameters `<param>__0` .. `<param>__(<param>__count-1)` setting `<param>` for each value.
*   `#reactive on|off`: Toggle reactive rendering. PageQL starts in reactive mode, automatically wrapping dynamic output so changes can be pushed to the browser. Use `#reactive off` to disable live updates and `#reactive on` to re-enable them.

**Debugging:**
*   `#dump <expression>`: Dumps a table / SQL expression with timing info
*   `#log <message>`: Writes a message to a log.

**Page Processing:**

*   `#statuscode <expression>`: Sets the HTTP response status code.
*   `#redirect <url_expression>`: Performs an HTTP redirect by setting the `Location` header and status code to 302.
*   `#error <expression>`: Raises an error with the evaluated expression.
*   `#header <name> <value_expression>`: Sets an HTTP response header. The `<name>` (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `"X-Custom-Header"`) and `<value_expression>` (e.g., `"no-cache"`, `:some_variable`) are required positional arguments. Example: `#header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"`.
*   `#cookie <name> <expression> [options...]`: Sets an outgoing HTTP cookie. The `<name>` is a literal string and `<expression>` is evaluated to determine the cookie value. Optional attributes like `expires="..."`, `path="..."`, `domain="..."`, `secure`, and `httponly` may follow.

When a directive is mistyped or unrecognized, PageQL prints a list of valid directives with short syntax hints. These hints show minimal syntax like `#insert into <table> (cols) values (vals)`, `#update <table> set ... where ...`, or `#delete from <table> where ...`. This quick reference can help diagnose typos during development.

## Reactivity Mode

PageQL operates in reactive mode by default. Templates automatically
update in the browser whenever the underlying variables or SQL queries
change. Use `#reactive off` before a section that should render
statically, and `#reactive on` to re-enable live updates. The mode
persists from the point it is toggled until the opposite directive is
encountered.

## Parameter Binding & Output

PageQL uses a unified namespace for variables originating from different sources:

*   Request parameters declared and validated via `#param`.
*   Variables explicitly set using `#let`.
*   Columns selected within a `#from` loop (each column becomes a variable within the loop's scope). A special `__first_row` parameter is also set to `1` for the first row and `0` thereafter. `__first_row` is not reactive and was created mainly to assist with static JSON output.
*   Parameters passed to a partial via `#render <partial> param_name=value`.
*   (Potentially cookie values, details TBD).

The engine distinguishes between binding these variables *into* SQL queries and rendering their values *into* the HTML output.

**1. SQL Parameter Binding (`:param_name`)**

*   **Purpose:** To safely include dynamic values within SQL statements (`WHERE` clauses, `VALUES` lists, `SET` assignments in `#from`, `#insert`, `#update`, `#delete`, `#merge`, `#let ... from`).
*   **Syntax:** Use a colon prefix followed by the parameter name (e.g., `:user_id`, `:search_term`, `:text`, `:id`, `:active_count`).
*   **Security:** **This is the ONLY safe way to include dynamic data in SQL queries.** It prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring the database driver handles the value correctly, rather than simply concatenating strings. The colon prefix is **mandatory** in these SQL contexts.
*   **`#from` Scope:** Within a `#from` loop, each selected column is directly accessible as a parameter using the colon prefix (e.g., `{{ :column_name }}`).

**2. Output Rendering and Simple Conditions (`{{ }}` and `#if`)**

*   **Purpose:** To display variable values within the HTML template content or use them in simple conditional checks.
*   **Standard Syntax (`{{ :variable }}` or `#if :variable`):** Using the colon prefix is always valid and often preferred for consistency.
*   **Optional Colon Shorthand (`{{ variable }}` or `#if variable`):** The colon prefix (`:`) **can be omitted** *if and only if* the expression consists of a **single variable name**.
    *   Example: `{{ my_var }}` is allowed (equivalent to `{{ :my_var }}`).
    *   Example: `#if my_var` is allowed (equivalent to `#if :my_var`).
    *   This shorthand **cannot** be used for more complex expressions within `{{ }}` or `#if`. For instance, `{{ my_var + 1 }}` or `#if my_var > 0` would require evaluation by the SQL engine and thus necessitate the colon prefix for clarity and proper parsing (e.g., `#if :my_var > 0`). The exact handling of complex expressions within `{{ }}` is still under consideration, but simple variable output is the primary use case.
*   **HTML Escaped Output (`{{ expression }}` or `{{ variable }}`):**
    *   This is the default and recommended way to output data.
    *   It automatically escapes HTML special characters (like `<`, `>`, `&`) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Context-Aware Quoting:** When used inside an HTML attribute value (`<input value={{ :username }}>` or `<input value={{ username }}>`) or within a `<script>` tag for generating JSON-like structures, it *should ideally* automatically wrap string values in appropriate quotes (`<input value="Adam">`). *(Implementation detail)*
*   **Raw/Unescaped Output (`{{{ expression }}}` or `{{{ variable }}}`):**
    *   Outputs the variable's value directly without any HTML escaping. The same optional colon rule applies.
    *   **Use with extreme caution!** Only use this if you are certain the variable contains safe, pre-sanitized HTML or content that should not be escaped. Incorrect use can easily lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

## Expressions

PageQL does not define its own expression language. Instead, it leverages the expression evaluation capabilities of the underlying SQL database engine (e.g., SQLite).

Expressions are primarily used in:

*   **`#if <expression>` / `#elif <expression>`:** To conditionally render blocks of content. The expression should evaluate to a boolean-like value (in SQLite, 0 is false, non-zero is true). If the expression is more complex than a single variable name, it **must** use the colon prefix for variables (e.g., `#if :count > 10`).
*   **`#let :<variable> = <expression> [from ...]`:** To compute a value to assign to a variable. Variables used within the `<expression>` **must** use the colon prefix (e.g., `#let :total_price = :quantity * :unit_price`).
*   **`WHERE <expression>` clauses:** Within database query tags (`#from`, `#update`, `#delete`, `#merge`, `#let ... from`) to filter data. Variables **must** use the colon prefix (e.g., `WHERE user_id = :id`).
*   **Value clauses:** In `#insert` (`values (...)`), `#update` (`set col = ...`), `#cookie`, `#header`, `#redirect`. Variables **must** use the colon prefix.

**Allowed Expressions:**

Generally, you can use standard SQL expressions supported by your database, such as:

*   Comparisons (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `LIKE`, `IN`)
*   Logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)
*   Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
*   Standard SQL functions (e.g., `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`, `LENGTH()`, `SUBSTR()`, `DATE()`, aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)

**Important:** Since expressions are evaluated by the database, their exact syntax and available functions depend on the specific SQL database being used (primarily SQLite in the initial design). Variables within these expressions must be prefixed with `:`.

## Comments

PageQL templates support three comment styles:

```html
{{! This comment will not show up in the output}}
<!-- This comment will show up as HTML-comment -->
{{!-- This comment may contain mustaches like }} --}}
```

The first and third forms are stripped from the rendered output. The HTML comment remains and will appear in the final HTML.

## Integration & Extensibility

PageQL applications can register hooks that run before or after a template is rendered. Use `@app.before('/path')` to modify parameters before rendering.

```python
@app.before('/path')
async def before_handler(params):
    params['title'] = 'Custom Title'
    return params
```

The returned dictionary is merged into the template namespace.

If a file named `_before.pageql` exists in the template directory root it
executes before every request. When it returns a status code of `200`, rendering
continues with any modifications the template makes to the parameters. Other
status codes short‑circuit rendering and their response is sent directly.

PageQLApp also exposes several helper SQLite functions automatically when it
starts:

* `base64_encode(blob)` - encode binary values as a Base64 string
* `base64_decode(text)` - decode a Base64 string back into text
* `jws_serialize_compact(payload)` - sign a payload using JSON Web Signature
* `jws_deserialize_compact(token)` - extract the payload from a JWS token
* `query_param(qs, name)` - return the first value of ``name`` from ``qs``
* `html_escape(text)` - escape special characters in ``text`` for safe HTML output
