               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         
               "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
               the Work and derivative works thereof.
         
               "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
               the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
               to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
               submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

               systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
               of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work,
               but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
               sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in
               Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright notice and license terms for Your
               Derivative Works for use by You or Your licensees, in addition to
               or in replacement of the license terms of this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Support. You may choose to offer, and to
               charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or other liability
               obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
               accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
               Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
               only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
               harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
               such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or support.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. Don't include

# aws-s3-share

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aws-s3-share) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/aws-s3-share) ![PyPI - License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/aws-s3-share)

A command-line tool for compressing files or directories, uploading them to Amazon S3, then generating a pre-signed URL for easy sharing.  This is useful for example for uploading/downloading files from EC2 instances without direct connexion to the Internet.

Compressed archives are uploaded with a random 12-characters long prefix to avoid overwriting of files of the same name.

## Features

- **Compression**: .gz for files, tar.gz for directories
- **Multipart S3 Upload**: Efficient uploads to Amazon S3
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Generate pre-signed URLs with configurable expiry
- **Progress Tracking**: Progress bars for compression and upload
- **AWS Profile Support**: Use AWS profiles for authentication
- **OS Independent**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv add aws-s3-share
```

### Using pipx

```bash
pipx install aws-s3-share
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install aws-s3-share
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Upload a file
aws-s3-share --bucket my-bucket myfile.txt

# Upload a directory
aws-s3-share --bucket my-bucket mydirectory/

# Specify expiry time (in seconds)
aws-s3-share  --bucket my-bucket --expiry 7200 myfile.txt

# Specify an AWS profile
aws-s3-share --bucket my-bucket --profile myprofile myfile.txt
```

## Configuration

aws-s3-share supports command-line arguments and reading its options from a configuration file (`~/.config/aws-s3-share.toml` on Linux/macOS, `%AppData%\Roaming\aws-s3-share.toml` on Windows).  Valid configuration file options are `bucket`, `expiry`, and `profile`.

Options are applied in this order of precedence:

1. Command-line arguments (highest priority)
2. Configuration file options
3. Default values (lowest priority, expiry only)

### Command-line Options

```bash
aws-s3-share [OPTIONS] PATH

Options:
  -b, --bucket TEXT     S3 bucket to upload to
  -e, --expiry INTEGER  Pre-signed URL expiry time in seconds (default: 3600)
  -p, --profile TEXT    AWS profile name to use for authentication
  -h, --help           Show this message and exit
  --version            Show the version and exit
```

### AWS Credentials

If neither the command-line argument `--profile` nor the configuration file option `profile` is provided, aws-s3-share uses the standard AWS credential chain:

1. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
2. AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
3. IAM roles (when running on EC2)

## Required IAM Permissions
