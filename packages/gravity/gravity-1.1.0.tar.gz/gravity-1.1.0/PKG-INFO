Overview
========

Modern Galaxy servers run multiple disparate processes: `gunicorn`_ for serving the web application, `celery`_ for
asynchronous tasks, `tusd`_ for fault-tolerant uploads, standalone Galaxy processes for job handling, and more. Gravity
is Galaxy's process manager, to make configuring and running these services simple.

Installing Gravity will give you two executables, ``galaxyctl`` which is used to manage the starting, stopping, and
logging of Galaxy's various processes, and ``galaxy``, which can be used to run a Galaxy server in the foreground.

Quick Start
===========

Installation
------------

Python 3.7 or later is required. Gravity can be installed independently of Galaxy, but it is also a dependency of
Galaxy since Galaxy 22.01. If you've installed Galaxy, then Gravity is already installed in Galaxy's virtualenv.

To install independently:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install gravity

Usage
-----

From the root directory of a source checkout of Galaxy, after first run (or running Galaxy's
``./scripts/common_startup.sh``), activate Galaxy's virtualenv, which will put Gravity's ``galaxyctl`` and ``galaxy``
commands on your ``$PATH``:

.. code:: console

    $ . ./.venv/bin/activate
    $ galaxyctl --help
    Usage: galaxyctl [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Manage Galaxy server configurations and processes.

    ... additional help output

You can start and run Galaxy in the foreground using the ``galaxy`` command:

.. code:: console

    $ galaxy
    Registered galaxy config: /srv/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml
    Creating or updating service gunicorn
    Creating or updating service celery
    Creating or updating service celery-beat
    celery: added process group
    2022-01-20 14:44:24,619 INFO spawned: 'celery' with pid 291651
    celery-beat: added process group
    2022-01-20 14:44:24,620 INFO spawned: 'celery-beat' with pid 291652
    gunicorn: added process group
    2022-01-20 14:44:24,622 INFO spawned: 'gunicorn' with pid 291653
    celery                           STARTING
    celery-beat                      STARTING
    gunicorn                         STARTING
    ==> /srv/galaxy/var/gravity/log/gunicorn.log <==
    ...log output follows...

Galaxy will continue to run and output logs to stdout until terminated with ``CTRL+C``.

0.9
===

- Gunicorn/fastAPI support, click support, tests by @mvdbeek in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/14
- Don't test on Python 3.6, which is unsupported by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/17
- Update README. Also some various small bugfixes and fixes for other stuff mentioned in the README by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/18
- Add unicornherder support by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/15
- Expose the log following used by `start -f` as its own subcommand. by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/16
- Better integration with Galaxy's run.sh by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/19
- Use relative paths in supervisord by @natefoo in https://github.com/galaxyproject/gravity/pull/21
- Converted CLI from `argparse`_ to `click`_.
- Stole ideas and code from `planemo`_ in general.
- Improve the AttributeDict so that it can have "hidden" items (anything that
  starts with a ``_``) that won't be serialized. Also, it serializes itself and
  can be created via deserialization from a classmethod. This simplifies using
  it to persist state data in the new GravityState subclass.

0.8.3
=====

- Merge ``galaxycfg`` and ``galaxyadm`` commands to ``galaxy``.

0.8.2
=====

- Allow for passing names of individual services directly to ``supervisorctl``
  via the ``start``, ``stop``, and ``restart`` methods.
- Fix a bug where uWSGI would not start when using the automatic virtualenv
  install method.

0.8.1
=====

- Version bump because I deleted the 0.8 files from PyPI, and despite the fact
  that it lets you delete them, it doesn't let you upload once they have been
  uploaded once...

0.8
===

- Add auto-register to ``galaxy start`` if it's called from the root (or
  subdirectory) of a Galaxy root directory.
- Make ``galaxycfg remove`` accept instance names as params in addition to
  config file paths.
- Use the same hash generated for an instance name as the hash for a generated
  virtualenv name, so virtualenvs are more easily identified as belonging to a
  config.
- Renamed from ``galaxyadmin`` to ``gravity`` (thanks John Chilton).

0.7
===

- Added the ``galaxyadm`` subcommand ``graceful`` on a suggestion from Nicola
  Soranzo.
- Install uWSGI into the config's virtualenv if requested.
- Removed any dependence on Galaxy and eggs.
- Moved project to its own repository from the Galaxy clone I'd been working
  from.

Older
=====

- Works in progress as part of the Galaxy code.
