# BaderKit

## About

BaderKit is a python implementation of Bader's Atomic Theory of Atoms in Molecules. It is largely based on the algorithms of [Henkelman et. al.](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/) at UT Austin. The app is partially part of my PhD at UNC Chapel Hill in the [Warren Lab](https://materials-lab.io/) with funding from the [NSF's GRFP](https://nsfgrfp.org/), but is largely my own passion project aimed at making my life easier when developing other packages.

For information on installation and use, see the [docs](https://sweav02.github.io/baderkit/)
