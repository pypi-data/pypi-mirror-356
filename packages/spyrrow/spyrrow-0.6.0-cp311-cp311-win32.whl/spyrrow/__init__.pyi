        An Item represents any closed 2D shape by its outer boundary.

        Spyrrow doesn't support hole(s) inside the shape as of yet. Therefore no Item can be nested inside another.

        Args:
            id (str): The Item identifier
              Needs to be unique accross all Items of a StripPackingInstance
            shape: An ordered list of (x,y) defining the shape boundary. The shape is represented as a polygon formed by this list of points.
              The origin point can be included twice as the finishing point. If not, [last point, first point] is infered to be the last straight line of the shape.
            demand: The quantity of identical Items to be placed inside the strip. Should be positive.
            allowed_orientations (list[float]|None): List of angles in degrees allowed.
              An empty list is equivalent to [0.].
              A None value means that the item is free to rotate
              The algorithmn is only very weakly sensible to the length of the list given.
