## Why do we need this?

This package was developed primarily as a **basic** reverse geocoder for use within
web frameworks (APIs) that **have an existing PostGIS connection to utilise**.

Simple alternatives:

- The reverse geocoding package in Python [here](https://github.com/thampiman/reverse-geocoder)
  is probably the original and canonincal implementation using K-D tree.
  - However, it's a bit outdated now, with numerous unattended pull
    requests and uses an unfavourable multiprocessing-based approach.
  - It leaves a large memory footprint of approximately 260MB to load the
    K-D tree in memory (see [benchmarks](./benchmark-results.md)), which
    remains there: an unacceptable compromise for a web server for such a
    small amount of functionality.
- The package [here](https://github.com/richardpenman/reverse_geocode) is an excellent
  revamp of the package above, and possibly the best choice in many scenarios,
  particularly if PostGIS is not available.

The pg-nearest-city approach:

- Is approximately ~20x more performant (45ms --> 2ms).
- Has a small ~8MB memory footprint, compared to ~260MB.
- However it has a one-time initialisation penalty of approximately 16s
  to load the data into the database (which could be handled at
  web server startup).

See [benchmarks](./benchmark-results.md) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't discuss web based geocoding services here, such as Nominatim, as simple
> offline reverse-geocoding has two purposes:
>
> - Reduced latency, when very precise locations are not required.
> - Reduced load on free services such as Nominatim (particularly when running
> in automated tests frequently).

### Priorities

- Lightweight package size.
- Minimal memory footprint.
- High performance.

### How This Package Works

- Ingest
  [geonames.org](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000%40public/export/?disjunctive.cou_name_en)
  CSV data for cities over 1000 population.
- Create voronoi polygons based on city geopoints.
- Bundle the voronoi data with this package and load into Postgis.
- Query the loaded voronoi data with a given geopoint, returning the city.

The diagram below should give a good indication for how this works:

## Usage

### Install

Distributed as a pip package on PyPi:

```bash
pip install pg-nearest-city
# or use your dependency manager of choice
```

### Run The Code

#### Async

```python
from pg_nearest_city import AsyncNearestCity

# Existing code to get db connection, say from API endpoint
db = await get_db_connection()

async with AsyncNearestCity(db) as geocoder:
    location = await geocoder.query(40.7128, -74.0060)

print(location.city)
# "New York City"
print(location.country)
# "USA"
```

#### Sync

```python
from pg_nearest_city import NearestCity

# Existing code to get db connection, say from API endpoint
db = get_db_connection()

with NearestCity(db) as geocoder:
    location = geocoder.query(40.7128, -74.0060)

print(location.city)
# "New York City"
print(location.country)
# "USA"
```

#### Create A New DB Connection

- If your app upstream already has a psycopg connection, this can be
  passed through.
- If you require a new database connection, the connection parameters
  can be defined as DbConfig object variables:

```python
from pg_nearest_city import DbConfig, AsyncNearestCity

db_config = DbConfig(
    dbname="db1",
    user="user1",
    password="pass1",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432",
)

async with AsyncNearestCity(db_config) as geocoder:
    location = await geocoder.query(40.7128, -74.0060)
```

- Or alternatively as variables from your system environment:

```dotenv
PGNEAREST_DB_NAME=cities
PGNEAREST_DB_USER=cities
PGNEAREST_DB_PASSWORD=somepassword
PGNEAREST_DB_HOST=localhost
PGNEAREST_DB_PORT=5432
```

then

```python
from pg_nearest_city import AsyncNearestCity

async with AsyncNearestCity() as geocoder:
    location = await geocoder.query(40.7128, -74.0060)
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
docker compose run --rm code pytest
```

## Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks with:

```bash
docker compose run --rm benchmark
```

## Voronoi Generator

### Overview

The pg-nearest-city package includes a Voronoi generator that creates the
data used for efficient reverse geocoding. This utility downloads city
data from GeoNames, processes it through PostGIS to compute Voronoi polygons,
and exports the results as compressed WKB files that are bundled with the
package.

### Data Generation

The generator is containerized and can be run using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose run --rm voronoi-generator
```

This process:

- Downloads city data from GeoNames (cities with population > 1000)
- Processes the data through PostGIS spatial functions
- Generates two output files in pg_nearest_city/data/:
  - `cities_1000_simple.txt.gz` - Simplified city data
  - `voronois.wkb.gz` - Compressed WKB representation of Voronoi polygons

### Configuration

The generator accepts the following configuration options:

- `--country` - Filter to a specific country code (e.g., IT)
- `--no-compress` - Disable output compression
- `--output-dir` - Custom output directory

### Updating Data

The pre-generated data files are bundled with the package,
so manual regeneration is only necessary when:

- New GeoNames data becomes available and you want to update
- You need to filter for a specific geographic region
- You need to customize the data processing pipeline
