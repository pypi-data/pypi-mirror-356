``pspy`` is a cosmology code for calculating CMB power spectra and covariance matrices. See the
python example notebooks for an introductory set of examples on how to use the package.

Installing
----------

.. code:: shell

    pip install pspy [--user]

You can test your installation by running

.. code:: shell

    test-pspy

If everything goes fine, no errors will occur. Otherwise, you can report your problem on the `Issues
tracker <https://github.com/simonsobs/pspy/issues>`_.

If you plan to develop ``pspy``, it is better to checkout the latest version by doing

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/simonsobs/pspy.git /where/to/clone

Once downloaded, you can install using ``pip install .`` inside the project directory. We use the
``meson`` build system, which should be understood by ``pip`` (it will build in an isolated
environment).

To run an editable install, you will need to do so in a way that does not have build isolation (as
the backend build system, ``meson`` and ``ninja``, actually perform micro-builds on usage in this
case):

Then you can install the ``pspy`` library and its dependencies *via*

.. code:: shell

    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools meson ninja meson-python numpy
    pip install --no-build-isolation --editable /where/to/clone

The ``-e`` option allow the developer to make changes within the ``pspy`` directory without having
to reinstall at every changes.
