## Overview
PIPEIQ is an open-source framework that enables developers to seamlessly connect and orchestrate AI tools across the Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. It abstracts away the complexities of identity, messaging, and orchestration by providing standardized primitives for agent coordination, tool invocation, and cross-network integration.

With native support for models, MCP servers, decentralized compute providers, and on-chain identity frameworks, PIPEIQ aims to serve as a universal protocol layer for the AI economy—supporting autonomous, composable, and verifiable AI agents.

## Key Features

### 🔗 Web2 + Web3 Interop
- Unified routing for AI tools—OpenAI, HuggingFace, MCP servers, Filecoin compute, etc.
- Tool registration and capability exposure via agent profiles

### 🔑 Identity & Wallets
- On-chain agent identities (machine & human-aligned)
- Verifiable credentials & optional proof-of-personhood

### 📊 Staking & Reputation
- Reputation-linked staking mechanisms
- Trust scores based on usage history & task completion

### ⚖️ Agent Task Market
- Publish & bid on decentralized agent tasks
- Support for escrow, arbitration, and bounty resolution

### 🌐 Context Anchoring
- Persistent agent memory using IPFS / Arweave
- Modular context schemas for task recall & chaining

### 🤷 Intent Signaling & Routing
- Message schema for goal-driven task delegation
- Modular routing system between agents & services

---

## Architecture

The framework is built on two foundational layers:

### 1. Blockchain-Native Primitives
- ✅ Solana Smart Contracts (Rust)
- ✨ Token Programs for $PIPEIQ
- ⚖️ DAO governance (via Realms)

### 2. Agent-Centric Primitives
- 🤖 Agent Profiles & Permissions
- 🚧 Task Markets & Context Anchors
- 📢 Intent Signaling System
