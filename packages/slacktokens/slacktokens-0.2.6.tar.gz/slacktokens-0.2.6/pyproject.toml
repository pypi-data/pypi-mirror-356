# Python 3.12 deprecates "PyUnicode_AS_UNICODE", which python-leveldb relies on. I
# haven't found a workaround, so just require 3.11 for now. I've read "Should You Use
# Upper Bound Version Contraints" and got thoroughly turned off by the hyperrationality.
# Turns out, in amongst the vehement denial of pragmatism, there's a fundamental flaw
# in upper bounds - most resolvers, like pip, will quietly "roll back" and just install
# the last version without this bound! This is not the intended effect, which is to
# um... require 3.11. Since this is still the intention, I will also yank all previous
# versions to get the intended outcome. People can still use the previous versions if
# they want, but by default they will just have to install 3.11 and will get the
# current, functional version.
