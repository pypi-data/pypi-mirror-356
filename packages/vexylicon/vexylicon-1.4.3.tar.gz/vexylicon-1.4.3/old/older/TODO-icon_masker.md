Look at `mask-dark.png` (result of `svg2png-adam.sh mask-dark.svg 1200`)

The point was that instead of a solid gray color like `icon-perfect.png` which we recreated in the `best_full.png` (and it comes from `best_full.svg` and that in turn comes via `icon_blender.py` from `best_base.svg`), we want to have a "glass" into which we can insert a payload.
