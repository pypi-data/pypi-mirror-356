# IVIMNET
This repository contains the code regarding the publication: Improved unsupervised physics-informed deep learning for intravoxel-incoherent motion modeling and evaluation in pancreatic cancer patients. (example1.py, example2.py and example3.py)


it also contains the code for: Self-supervised neural network improves tri-exponential intravoxel incoherent motion model fitting compared to least-squares fitting in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (tri_exp_examples.example_tri_exp.py)

Built on code by Sebastiano Barbieri: https://github.com/sebbarb/deep_ivim

#### requirements:

numpy

torch

tqdm

matplotlib

scipy

joblib


To directly run the code, we added a '.yml' file which can be run in anaconda. 

To create a conda environment with the '.yml' file enter the command below in the terminal: conda env create -f environment.yml

This now creates an environment called 'ivim' that can be activated by: conda activate ivim


## For easy start, run the examples
### example1.py
This is a very simple visual example in which we simulate a square in a square in a square and show its performance. 

### example2.py
This is a example where we simulate a lot of varied data and calculate the accuracy and precission. Output will be tables with accuracy and precission.

### example3.py
Here we load 1 dataset, train the network, and do the IVIM fit in this patient. **NOTE:** this is a *toy-example* in which you will train and evaluate in **the same single patient**. For larger studies, we would advice you to train 1 single network that you apply to all patients, instead of training a network on a per patient basis. This requieres you to adapt the code.

### tri_exp_examples.example_tri_exp.py
This is similar to 2, but with tri-exponential model.
