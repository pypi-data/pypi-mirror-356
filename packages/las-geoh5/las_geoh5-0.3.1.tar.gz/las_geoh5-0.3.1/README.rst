las-geoh5
=========

Import/Export LAS files to/from geoh5 format.

This package allows for import and export of LAS files to and from a drillhole group.
There is a module each for import and export operations.  Each of these includes a driver
and a ui.json that parameterizes the driver and renders a UI for use within `Geoscience ANALYST Pro`_.
Read on to learn how to install las-geoh5 and get started importing and exporting LAS files.

Installation
------------

Install **las-geoh5** with ``pip`` from PyPI::

    $ pip install las-geoh5


Or from a branch on `github <https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/las-geoh5>`_::

    $ pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/las-geoh5/archive/refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME.zip

(to use a tag rather than a branch, replace ``heads\BRANCH_NAME.zip`` by ``tags\TAG_NAME.zip``)


Or from a local sources, after you have cloned the repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/las-geoh5 [-b BRANCH_NAME]
    $ pip install -e las-geoh5


Basic Usage
-----------

From Geoscience Analyst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. _Geoscience ANALYST Pro: https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst-pro/

The most convenient way to use this package is through `Geoscience ANALYST Pro`_
where the import files driver may be run from the **file -> import**
menu.

All drivers may also be run from a ui.json file in `Geoscience ANALYST Pro`_
by either adding to the Python Scripts directory or drag and drop into
the viewport. Defaulted ui.json files can be found in the uijson folder
of the las-geoh5 project.

From command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run from command line, prepare first a JSON file with the parameters required for conversion.

Then execute with::

    $ las_to_geoh5 parameters.json [-o output_geoh5]
    $ geoh5_to_las parameters.json [-o output_dir]

where ``parameters.json`` is the path on disk to a JSON file with required input parameters.

If optional ``-o`` (or ``--out``) value is not provided, the program will write out to the location
specified by the JSON file.
