## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install wa-automation
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from wa_automation import WhatsAppAutomation

# Initialize WhatsApp automation
whatsapp = WhatsAppAutomation()

# Send a message
whatsapp.send_message("1234567890", "Hello from WA-Automation!")

# Send an image with caption
whatsapp.send_image("1234567890", "path/to/image.jpg", "Check out this photo!")

# Send a file with caption
whatsapp.send_file("1234567890", "path/to/document.pdf", "Here's the document you requested")

# Clean up when done
whatsapp.cleanup()
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Chrome browser
- Stable internet connection
- Active WhatsApp account

## Detailed Usage

### Initialization

```python
from wa_automation import WhatsAppAutomation

# Default initialization
whatsapp = WhatsAppAutomation()

# Custom user data directory
whatsapp = WhatsAppAutomation(user_data_dir="custom/path/to/user_data")
```

### Sending Messages

```python
# Simple text message
whatsapp.send_message("1234567890", "Hello!")

# Send to multiple numbers
numbers = ["1234567890", "0987654321"]
for number in numbers:
    whatsapp.send_message(number, "Bulk message")
```

### Sending Images

```python
# Send image without caption
whatsapp.send_image("1234567890", "path/to/image.jpg")

# Send image with caption
whatsapp.send_image("1234567890", "path/to/image.jpg", "Beautiful sunset!")
```

### Sending Files

```python
# Send file without caption
whatsapp.send_file("1234567890", "path/to/document.pdf")

# Send file with caption
whatsapp.send_file("1234567890", "path/to/document.pdf", "Monthly report")
```

## Error Handling

The library provides custom exceptions for better error handling:

```python
from wa_automation import WhatsAppAutomationError, MessageSendError

try:
    whatsapp.send_message("1234567890", "Hello!")
except MessageSendError as e:
    print(f"Failed to send message: {e}")
except WhatsAppAutomationError as e:
    print(f"General automation error: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use the `cleanup()` method when you're done:

   ```python
   try:
       whatsapp.send_message("1234567890", "Hello!")
   finally:
       whatsapp.cleanup()
   ```

2. Use context manager (coming soon):

   ```python
   with WhatsAppAutomation() as whatsapp:
       whatsapp.send_message("1234567890", "Hello!")
   ```

3. Handle rate limiting:

   ```python
   import time

   numbers = ["1234567890", "0987654321"]
   for number in numbers:
       whatsapp.send_message(number, "Hello!")
       time.sleep(2)  # Add delay between messages
   ```

## Known Limitations

- Requires active internet connection
- Chrome browser must be installed
- Phone must be connected to WhatsApp Web
- Message delivery depends on recipient's connectivity
