# Transqlate

**Transqlate** is a production‑ready natural language → SQL assistant powered by a fine‑tuned Phi‑4 Mini model.
It lets anyone—technical or not—create and run complex queries over **SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, or Oracle databases** using plain English.

---

## Key Features

* **Schema‑Aware NL→SQL** – Automatically extracts your database schema and prunes it with an RAG pipeline so prompts fit within model limits.
* **Interactive CLI** – Generate queries, explore schemas, edit or write SQL, and dynamically switch connections with `:changedb` (alias `:change_db`).
* **Safe Execution** – DDL/DML statements require explicit confirmation. Lost connections trigger an optional reconnect with troubleshooting tips.
* **Chain‑of‑Thought Reasoning** – View the model’s reasoning and final SQL, converted from SQLite syntax to your database dialect with automatic schema qualification.
* **Customizable Inference** – Control maximum generation length (`--max-new-tokens`), enable Python tracebacks for debugging, and point to local or HF-hosted model weights.
* **Offline‑Friendly** – Runs on CPU and can pre‑download the sentence‑transformer embedding model so future runs work without internet access.
* **Supports One‑Shot Queries** – Use `-q "question"` for quick, non‑interactive SQL generation.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install transqlate
```

---

## Usage

**Launch the interactive CLI:**

```bash
transqlate --interactive
```

**Run a single question:**

```bash
transqlate -q "List all customers who made purchases in March." --db-path path/to/database.db
```

REPL commands include `:show schema`, `:history`, `:edit`, `:write`, `:examples`, `:clear`, `:changedb`, `:about`, and `:exit`.

## What's New in v0.1.2

- **Cross-dialect SQL post-processing:** Automatically transforms model-generated (SQLite-style) SQL into the target dialect (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle) with clear conversion notices.
- **Enhanced CLI workflow:** Added `:edit` for modifying generated SQL, `:write` for manual queries, and seamless database switching with `:changedb`/`:change_db`.
- **Improved schema extraction:** Robust support for PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL with qualified and escaped identifiers; Oracle system tables can now be filtered.
- **Safer execution and state management:** CLI now detects and recovers from lost connections, rolls back on errors, and requires confirmation for DDL/DML.
- **History and troubleshooting:** Query history now shows manual/edited status and execution results. Added `:troubleshoot` for step-by-step connection help.
- **Token limit control:** Set output length using the `--max-new-tokens` argument (default: 2048).
- **Numerous bugfixes and UX refinements:** Identifier quoting, error messages, startup feedback, and more.

## What's New in v0.1.3

**Spreadsheet Mode (CSV/Excel) Support & Enhanced Exporting**

* **Spreadsheet/CSV Mode:**
  You can now use Transqlate with your Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) and CSV files! At startup, select Spreadsheet/CSV mode and provide your file path. The tool will automatically convert your spreadsheet into a temporary SQLite database, enabling you to run natural language queries just like with any database.

* **Multi-Sheet Excel Support:**
  If your Excel file has multiple sheets, Transqlate will prompt you to choose which sheet to work with, ensuring a seamless experience across complex spreadsheets.

* **Export Results to CSV or Excel:**
  After running your queries, use the new `:export` command to save results or entire tables as CSV or Excel files for easy sharing and further analysis.
  Example:

  ```
  :export csv "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Total > 1000" big_orders.csv
  :export excel Customers customers.xlsx
  ```

* **Improved Help and Documentation:**
  The `:help` and `:about` commands have been revamped for clarity, providing concise guidance in the CLI and detailed usage instructions in the manual.

* **Context-Aware Commands:**
  Command menus and help are now tailored to your current mode, making the CLI cleaner and easier to use.

**Upgrade to v0.1.3 and unlock the power of natural language queries for spreadsheets, with robust export features and a streamlined user experience!**
