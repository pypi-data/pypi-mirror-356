def interpolate(xd, yd, xi, degree=3):
    """
    Python wrapper for the Improved Akima method from Akima (1986).

    Parameters
    ----------
    xd : Numpy ndarry
        Numpy array of input x coordinates. Must be monotonically
        increasing. Fails in Fortran.
    yd : Numpy ndarray
        Numpy array of input y coordinates. Must be monotonically
        increasing. Fails in Fortran.
    xi : Numpy ndarray
        Numpy array of output x coordinates. Can be in any order.
        Will be more efficient if monotonic.
    degree : Integer
        Polynomial order. Default: 3.

    Returns
    -------
    yi : Numpy ndarray
        Numpy array of output y coordinates, same length as xi.

    NOTES
    -----
    - In the UVIPIA Fortran code, any polynomial orders less than 3
      are automatically set to 3.
    - Technically, Akima's code only has the accuracy of a third-order
      polynomial, so while one can use higher-order polynomials, the
      internal logic is not designed to take advantage of that.
    - All internal calls to UVIPIA are up-rezzed to double precision.
    - Since this is directly calling the Fortran, for date/times, they
      probably need to be converted to seconds-from-initial.
