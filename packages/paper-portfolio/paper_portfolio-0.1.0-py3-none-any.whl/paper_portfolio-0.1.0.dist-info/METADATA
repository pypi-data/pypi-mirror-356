# paper-portfolio: Portfolio Construction & Performance Evaluation 📈

`paper-portfolio` is the final component of the P.A.P.E.R (Platform for Asset Pricing Experimentation and Research) monorepo. It provides a powerful, configuration-driven framework for constructing investment portfolios based on the predictive outputs of machine learning models and evaluating their economic significance.

Using the prediction files generated by `paper-model`, this package allows you to backtest various long-short portfolio strategies, calculate standard performance metrics, and generate insightful reports and visualizations.

## ✨ Features

*   **Flexible Portfolio Construction:**
    *   **Long-Short Strategies:** Easily construct long-short portfolios by sorting assets based on their predicted returns each month.
    *   **Quantile-Based Selection:** Define portfolio legs using specific quantile ranges (e.g., long top 10%, short bottom 10%).
    *   **Weighting Schemes:** Supports both **`equal`** (equally-weighted) and **`value`** (e.g., market-cap weighted) portfolio construction.
*   **Comprehensive Performance Evaluation:**
    *   **Standard Metrics:** Calculates `annualized_sharpe_ratio`, `expected_shortfall` (CVaR), and tracks `cumulative_return`.
    *   **Benchmarking**: Automatically compares strategies against the risk-free rate and an optional, user-provided **market index benchmark**.
*   **In-Depth Analysis:**
    *   **Cross-Sectional Analysis**: Optionally generates plots showing the cumulative performance of assets sorted into deciles by prediction. This is crucial for checking if the model's predictions are monotonically related to returns.
*   **Configuration-Driven Workflow:**
    *   Define all portfolio strategies, the models to test, benchmarks, and metrics to calculate in a single, human-readable `portfolio-config.yaml` file. This ensures reproducibility and simplifies experimentation.
*   **Automated Reporting & Visualization:**
    *   Generates detailed summary reports in text files for each model-strategy combination.
    *   Automatically creates and saves PNG plots of cumulative returns, providing a clear visual comparison of the long, short, and combined portfolios against benchmarks.
    *   Saves detailed monthly portfolio returns to Parquet files for deeper, custom analysis.
*   **Seamless Integration:**
    *   Directly consumes the `.parquet` prediction files produced by `paper-model`.
    *   Orchestrated by the `paper-tools` CLI for a smooth, end-to-end research pipeline.

## 🚀 Installation

`paper-portfolio` is designed to be part of the larger `PAPER` monorepo.

**Recommended (as part of `paper-tools`):**

This method ensures `paper-portfolio` is available to the main `paper` CLI orchestrator.

```bash
# Using pip
pip install "paper-tools[portfolio]"

# Using uv
uv pip install "paper-tools[portfolio]"
```

**Standalone Installation:**

If you only need `paper-portfolio` and its core functionalities for a different project.

```bash
# Using pip
pip install paper-portfolio

# Using uv
uv pip install paper-portfolio
```

**From Source (for development within the monorepo):**

Navigate to the root of your `PAPER` monorepo and install `paper-portfolio` in editable mode.

```bash
# Using pip
pip install -e ./paper-portfolio

# Using uv
uv pip install -e ./paper-portfolio
```

## 📖 Usage Workflow

The `paper-portfolio` pipeline is the final step in the P.A.P.E.R workflow.

### 1. Prerequisites: Data and Model Pipelines

Before running the portfolio phase, you must first run the data and model pipelines to generate the necessary inputs.

```bash
# Assuming you are in your project directory (e.g., ThesisExample)

# 1. Run the data phase
paper execute data

# 2. Run the models phase
paper execute models
```

After these steps, your project's `models/predictions/` directory should contain files like `OLS_model_predictions.parquet`.

### 2. Portfolio Configuration (`portfolio-config.yaml`)

Create or edit the `portfolio-config.yaml` file in your project's `configs` directory. This file defines which models to test and which portfolio strategies to apply.

```yaml
# MyProjectExample/configs/portfolio-config.yaml

input_data:
  # List of model names whose predictions you want to evaluate.
  # These must match the names from models-config.yaml.
  prediction_model_names:
    - "OLS_model"
    - "GBRT_tuned"
  
  # The base name of the processed dataset used by the models.
  processed_dataset_name: "processed_panel_data"
  
  # Column names required for calculations.
  date_column: "date"
  id_column: "permno"
  risk_free_rate_col: "rf"
  value_weight_col: "marketcap" # For value-weighting

# Optional: Define a market index for benchmark comparison.
# The CSV file must be placed in the `portfolios/indexes/` directory.
market_benchmark:
  name: "Market Index"
  file_name: "market_index.csv"
  date_column: "caldt"
  return_column: "vwretd"
  date_format: "%Y%m%d"

# A list of portfolio strategies to backtest for each model.
strategies:
  - name: "Decile_Sort_Equal_Weighted"
    weighting_scheme: "equal"
    long_quantiles: [0.9, 1.0]   # Long the top 10%
    short_quantiles: [0.0, 0.1]  # Short the bottom 10%

  - name: "Decile_Sort_Value_Weighted"
    weighting_scheme: "value"
    long_quantiles: [0.9, 1.0]
    short_quantiles: [0.0, 0.1]

# A list of performance metrics to calculate and report.
metrics:
  - "sharpe_ratio"
  - "expected_shortfall"
  - "cumulative_return"

# Enable the generation of cross-sectional decile return plots.
cross_sectional_analysis: true
```

### 3. Running the Portfolio Pipeline

Execute the portfolio phase using the `paper-tools` CLI from your project directory.

```bash
# Assuming you are in your project directory (e.g., MyProjectExample)
paper execute portfolio
```

### 4. Expected Output

**Console Output:**

The console will show a high-level success message.

```
>>> Executing Portfolio Phase <<<
Portfolio phase completed successfully. Additional information in 'MyProjectExample/logs.log'
```

**`ThesisExample/portfolios/results/` Directory:**

The `results` directory will be populated with detailed reports and plots for each model-strategy combination.

```ThesisExample/portfolios/results/
├── cross_sectional_analysis/
│   ├── GBRT_tuned_cross_sectional_returns.png
│   └── OLS_model_cross_sectional_returns.png
├── GBRT_tuned_Decile_Sort_Equal_Weighted_cumulative_return.png
├── GBRT_tuned_Decile_Sort_Equal_Weighted_monthly_returns.parquet
├── GBRT_tuned_Decile_Sort_Equal_Weighted_report.txt
├── GBRT_tuned_Decile_Sort_Value_Weighted_cumulative_return.png
├── ... (and so on for all models and strategies)
```

**Example Report (`OLS_model_Decile_Sort_Value_Weighted_report.txt`):**

```
--- Portfolio Performance Report ---
Model: OLS_model
Strategy: Decile_Sort_Value_Weighted

sharpe_ratio: 1.2543
