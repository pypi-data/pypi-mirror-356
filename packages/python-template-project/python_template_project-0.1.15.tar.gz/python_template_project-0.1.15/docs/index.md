This template provides a solid foundation for your next Python project, incorporating best practices for testing, automation, and distribution. It streamlines the development process with a comprehensive set of pre-configured tools and workflows, allowing you to focus on writing code.


## Feature overview

* **Testing:** Unit testing setup with `pytest`.
* **CI/CD:**  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for automated builds (Windows, macOS), unit tests, and code checks.
* **Code Formatting and Linting:** Pre-commit hook with the [RUFF auto-formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to ensure consistent code style.
* **Automated Builds:** GitHub pipeline for automatically building a Windows executable and a macOS installer.
* **Package Management:** Utilizes [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/), an extremely fast Python package manager, with dependencies managed in `pyproject.toml`.
* **Parameter-Driven Automation:**
    * Automatic generation of a configuration file from parameter definitions.
    * Automatic generation of a Command-Line Interface (CLI) from the same parameters.
    * Automatic generation of CLI API documentation.
* **Documentation:** Configuration for publishing documentation on [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) .
* **Workflow Automation:** A `Makefile` is included to simplify and automate common development tasks.
* **Minimalist GUI:** Comes with a basic GUI based on [tkinker](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) that includes an auto-generated settings menu based on your defined parameters.
* **Release pipeline:** Automated releases unsing the Makefile `make release` command, which creates a new tag and pushes it to the remote repo. The `release` pipeline will automatically create a new release on GitHub and trigger a release on PyPI.
    * **[setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)** is used to package the project and manage dependencies.
    * **[setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/)** is used to automatically generate the `_version.py` file from the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Getting started

1. **Create** a new [github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
2. **Clone** [github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the into your local file system.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```
4. **Install** [uv package and project manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
5. **Generate** [a sample project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#creating-a-new-project) with uv
6. Add and **push** the artifacts to your github repository
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
8. Copy the content of this repository into your repository

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with release pipeline

If you get this error below:
```bash
/home/runner/work/_temp/xxxx_xxx.sh: line 1: .github/release_message.sh: Permission denied
```

You have to run these commands in your IDE Terminal or the git bash and then push the changes.
```bash
git update-index --chmod=+x ./.github/release_message.sh
```
