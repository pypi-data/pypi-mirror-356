ASAP is a python package for fine-grained prediction of chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence, using ConvNeXt V2 blocks as powerful feature extractors. By integrating these blocks into diverse model architectures, including CNNs, LSTMs, dilated CNNs, and transformers, we demonstrate consistent performance gains, with the ConvNeXt-based dilated CNN achieving the most robust and shape-preserving predictions of ATAC-seq signal at 4 bp resolution. 

## Features

* Data Processing: Create datasets for whole-genome and peak-based analysis with support for blacklists and unmappable regions.
* Model Training: Train deep neural networks (e.g., ConvNext DCNN) on genomic data with customizable chromosome splits for training and validation.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on peak and whole-genome datasets, including robustness testing.
* Prediction: Export model predictions and predict SNV effects on ATAC-seq data.
* Scalability: Support for multi-GPU training and efficient data handling.

## Installation

ASAP is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install atac-asap
