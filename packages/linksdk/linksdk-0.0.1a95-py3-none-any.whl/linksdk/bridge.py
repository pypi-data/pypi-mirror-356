    from .wiim_device import WiimDevice # Changed from LinkPlayBridge

# The original LinkPlayBridge, LinkPlayDevice, LinkPlayPlayer classes are largely
# superseded by WiimDevice and its UPnP/HTTP capabilities.

# The LinkPlayMultiroom class logic for HTTP based multiroom control
# can be adapted and potentially moved into WiimController or kept here
# if it's complex enough and WiimController focuses on managing WiimDevice instances.

# For this refactor, we assume WiimController will handle multiroom logic
# by calling methods on WiimDevice instances (which might use HTTP commands).
# Therefore, this file might become redundant or only hold very specific legacy
# helper functions if any are still needed.

# Example: If there were complex parsing logic specific to multiroom HTTP responses
# that doesn't fit well in WiimController, it could live here.
# But for now, let's assume it's handled within WiimController.

# If LinkPlayMultiroom is still needed for HTTP multiroom command structures:
class WiimMultiroomGroup: # Renamed from LinkPlayMultiroom
    """
    Represents a WiiM multiroom group, primarily for HTTP-based multiroom commands.
    The actual state (leader, followers) is now managed by WiimController based on
    HTTP API responses. This class could be a data structure or provide helper methods
    if multiroom commands are complex.
    """
    leader: WiimDevice
    followers: List[WiimDevice]

        }

    # The methods like update_status, ungroup, add_follower, remove_follower, set_volume, mute, unmute
    # from the original LinkPlayMultiroom would now be implemented in WiimController,
    # operating on WiimDevice objects and their _http_request methods.

    # For instance, WiimController.async_join_group(leader_device, follower_device)
    # would construct and send the HTTP command.

# This file is now mostly empty or could be removed.
# Keeping it minimal for now.
