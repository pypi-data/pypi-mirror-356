**ChipStream** is a graphical user interface for postprocessing
deformability cytometry (DC) data. This includes background computation,
event segmentation, and feature extraction.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation, is available at
`chipstream.readthedocs.io <https://chipstream.readthedocs.io>`__.


Installation
------------
Installers for Windows and macOS are available at the `release page
<https://github.com/DC-analysis/ChipStream/releases>`__.

If you have Python installed, you can install ChipStream from PyPI

::

    # graphical user interface
    pip install chipstream[gui]
    # command-line interface
    pip install chipstream[cli]
    # both
    pip install chipstream[cli,gui]


Since version 0.6.0, you can also make use of torch-based segmentation
models.

::

    pip install chipstream[cli,gui,torch]

If you have a CUDA-compatible GPU and your Python installation cannot access the
GPU (`torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False`), please use the installation
instructions from pytorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For
instance, if you have CUDA 12.1, you can install torch with this pytorch.org
index URL:

::

    pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121


Execution
---------
If you have installed ChipStream from PyPI, you can start it with

::

    # graphical user interface
    chipstream-gui
    # command-line interface
    chipstream-cli


Citing ChipStream
-----------------
Please cite ChipStream either in-line

::

  (...) using the postprocessing software ChipStream version X.X.X
  (available at https://github.com/DC-analysis/ChipStream).

or in a bibliography

::

  Paul MÃ¼ller and others (2023), ChipStream version X.X.X: Postprocessing
  software for deformability cytometry [Software]. Available at
  https://github.com/DC-analysis/ChipStream.

and replace ``X.X.X`` with the version of ChipStream that you used.


Testing
-------

::

    pip install -e .
    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    pytest tests
