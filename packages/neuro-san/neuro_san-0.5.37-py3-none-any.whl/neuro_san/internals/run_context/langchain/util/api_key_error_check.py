A value for the {api_key} environment variable must be correctly set in the neuro-san
server or run-time enviroment in order to use this agent network.

Some things to try:
1) Double check that your value for {api_key} is set correctly
2) If you do not have a value for {api_key}, visit the LLM provider's website to get one.
3) It's possible that your credit balance on your account with the LLM provider is too low
   to make the request.  Check that.
4) Sometimes these errors happen because of firewall blockages to the site that hosts the LLM.
   Try checking that you can reach the regular UI for the LLM from a web browser
   on the same machine making this request.
