A personal project for experimenting with CARLA client, featuring vehicle control, sensor management, and visualization capabilities.

## Features

- Realistic vehicle physics and control
- Multiple sensor types (Camera, GNSS, Collision, Lane Invasion)
- Dynamic weather system
- Traffic and pedestrian simulation
- Real-time visualization with HUD and minimap
- Comprehensive logging and data collection
- Support for both manual and autopilot modes
- Configurable simulation parameters

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- CARLA Simulator 0.10.0
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tabulate
- PyYAML

## Installation

### From PyPI
```bash
pip install carla-driving-simulator-client
```

### From Source
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshaychikhalkar/carla-driving-simulator-client.git
cd carla-driving-simulator-client
```

2. Install in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Install CARLA:
- Download CARLA 0.10.0 from [CARLA's website](https://carla.org/)
- Extract the package and set the CARLA_ROOT environment variable
- Add CARLA Python API to your PYTHONPATH:
```bash
# For Windows
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\path\to\carla\PythonAPI\carla\dist\carla-0.10.0-py3.7-win-amd64.egg

# For Linux
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/carla/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.10.0-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg
```

## Usage

1. Start the CARLA server:
```bash
./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-rpc-port=2000
```

2. Run the simulator client:
```bash
# If installed from PyPI
carla-simulator-client

# If installed from source
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

The simulator client can be configured through the `config/simulation_config.yaml` file. Key parameters include:

- Target distance
- Maximum speed
- Simulation duration
- Vehicle model
- Sensor settings
- Weather conditions
