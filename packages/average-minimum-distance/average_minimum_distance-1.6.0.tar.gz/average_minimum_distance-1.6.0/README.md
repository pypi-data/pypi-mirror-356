## What's amd?

This package implements *pointwise distance distributions* (PDD), geometry-based crystal descriptors designed to have desirable properties such as independence from choice of a unit cell and continuity under perturbations of points. The average of PDD, the
*average minimum distance* (AMD), shares these properties while being
significantly faster to compare.

The typical representation of a crystal as a motif and unit cell is ambiguous, because many choices of cell and motif can define the same crystal. This package implements descriptors which are *isometry invariants*, meaning they are always the same for any two crystals which are geometrically equivalent, independent of a choice of unit cell and motif. These invariants can be compared to give a distance between crystals, which is 0 for identical crystals and close to 0 for similar crystals (a *continuous metric*).

The pointwise distance distribution records the environment of each atom in a unit cell by listing distances to neighbouring atoms in order. Two PDDs are compared using an optimal matching algorithm ([earth mover's distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance)). Taking the average of a PDD gives a vector called the *average minimum distance* (AMD), which are simpler and faster to compare but still identify crystals with similar geometry. Both have one parameter `k`, equal to the number of neighbouring atoms considered for each atom in the unit cell.

## Getting started

Use pip to install average-minimum-distance:

```shell
pip install average-minimum-distance
```

Then import average-minimum-distance with ```import amd```.

The following code extracts a crystal from two CIF files and compares them by
their pointwise distance distributions (PDD, neighbouring atoms k=100):

```py
import amd

# read
crystal1 = amd.CifReader('crystal1.cif').read()
crystal2 = amd.CifReader('crystal2.cif').read()

# calculate PDDs
k = 100
pdd1 = amd.PDD(crystal1, k)
pdd2 = amd.PDD(crystal2, k)

distance = amd.EMD(pdd1, pdd2)
```

Earth mover's distance (EMD) is the comparison metric used between PDDs. The `.read()` function of the :class:`amd.CifReader <amd.io.CifReader>` returns
one crystal (a :class:`amd.PeriodicSet <amd.periodicset.PeriodicSet>` object) if
only one is present in the CIF, otherwise it returns a list.

*CSD Python API only:* CSD entries can be accessed via the CSD Python API if it's installed with ```amd.CSDReader```, [see the documentation for details](https://average-minimum-distance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Reading_from_the_CSD.html). :class:`amd.CifReader <amd.io.CifReader>` can accept file formats other than CIF by passing ```reader='ccdc'```.

The following extracts collections of crystals from two CIF files and makes PDD and AMD distance matrices:

```py
import amd
import numpy as np

# read
crystals1 = list(amd.CifReader('crystals1.cif'))
crystals2 = list(amd.CifReader('crystals2.cif'))

# calculate PDD
k = 100
pdds1 = [amd.PDD(crystal, k) for crystal in crystals1]
pdds2 = [amd.PDD(crystal, k) for crystal in crystals2]

# distance matrix of EMDs between PDDs in each set
pdd_dm = amd.PDD_cdist(pdds1, pdds2)

# the above line is equivalent to:
pdd_dm = np.empty((len(pdds1), len(pdds2)), dtype=np.float64)
for i, pdd1 in enumerate(pdds1):
    for j, pdd2 in enumerate(pdds2):
        pdd_dm[i, j] = amd.EMD(pdd1, pdd2)

# calculates AMD from PDD, can be calculated from scratch with amd.AMD()
amds1 = [amd.PDD_to_AMD(pdd) for pdd in pdds1]
amds2 = [amd.PDD_to_AMD(pdd) for pdd in pdds2]

# distance matrix between AMDs, default metric is "chebyshev" (L-infinity)
amd_dm = amd.AMD_cdist(amds1, amds2)
```

The average minimum distance (AMD) is given by `amd.AMD()`,  which returns a vector instead of a matrix. These vectors can be compared by any metric on vectors, but the function `amd.AMD_cdist()` is a convenient function to batch compare AMDs in the same way as `amd.PDD_cdist()` above (essentially a wrapper of [SciPy's cdist](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cdist.html#scipy-spatial-distance-cdist)).
The functions `amd.PDD_pdist()` and `amd.AMD_pdist()` also exist
to compare one collection of crystals pairwise and return a condensed distance matrix like
[SciPy's pdist](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html#scipy-spatial-distance-pdist).

#### Choosing a value of k

The parameter k is the number of neighbouring atoms considered for each atom in a unit cell. Two crystals with the same unit molecule will have a small PDD/AMD distance for small enough k (e.g. k = 3), and a larger k means the geometry must be similar up to a larger radius for the distance to be small. The default we generally use is k = 100, but if this is significantly less than the number of atoms in the unit molecule, consider using a larger value. It is usually not useful to choose k too large (many times larger than the number of atoms in a unit cell).

## Example: AMD-based dendrogram

The following plots a single linkage dendrogram of crystals in a CIF using AMD:

```py
import amd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster import hierarchy

crystals = list(amd.CifReader('crystals.cif'))
names = [crystal.name for crystal in crystals]
amds = [amd.AMD(crystal, 100) for crystal in crystals]
cdm = amd.AMD_pdist(amds)
Z = hierarchy.linkage(cdm, 'single')
dn = hierarchy.dendrogram(Z, labels=names)
plt.show()
```
