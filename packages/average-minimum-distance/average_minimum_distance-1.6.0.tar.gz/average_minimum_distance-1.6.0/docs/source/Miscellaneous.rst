Invariants of finite point sets
-------------------------------
Pointwise distance distributions are also defined for finite point sets. :func:`amd.PDD_finite() <amd.calculate.PDD_finite>`
and :func:`amd.AMD_finite() <amd.calculate.AMD_finite>` accept a NumPy array containing the points and return the PDD/AMD respectively. 
Unlike :func:`amd.PDD() <amd.calculate.PDD>` and :func:`amd.AMD() <amd.calculate.AMD>`, no integer ``k`` is passed; instead the distances to all
neighbours are found (number of columns = number of points - 1).

::

    # Compare AMDs of trapezium and kite shaped finite point sets
    trapezium = np.array([[0,0],[1,1],[3,1],[4,0]])
    kite      = np.array([[0,0],[1,1],[1,-1],[4,0]])

    trap_amd = amd.AMD_finite(trapezium)
    kite_amd = amd.AMD_finite(kite)

    amd_dist = np.amax(np.abs(trap_amd - kite_amd))

Reconstruction of a periodic set from its PDD
---------------------------------------------
It is possible to reconstruct a periodic set up to isometry from its PDD if the periodic set
satisfies certain conditions (a 'general position') and the PDD has enough columns. This is 
implemented via the functions :func:`amd.PDD_reconstructable() <amd.calculate.PDD_reconstructable>`,
which returns the PDD of a periodic set with enough columns to reconstruct, and
:func:`amd.reconstruct.reconstruct() <amd.reconstruct.reconstruct>` which returns 
the motif given the PDD and unit cell. Reconstruction is not well optimised or tested.
