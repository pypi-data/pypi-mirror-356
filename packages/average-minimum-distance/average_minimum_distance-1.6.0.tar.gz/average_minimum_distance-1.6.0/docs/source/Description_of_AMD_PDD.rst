Description of PDD and AMD
==========================

The pointwise distance distribution (PDD) is a geometry-based descriptor of a crystal
represented by a periodic set. For a crystal :math:`S`, :math:`\text{PDD}(S)_{ik}` is
the distance between an atom corresponding to row
:math:`i` and its :math:`k`-th nearest neighbour in the infinite crystal.
So the PDD is a matrix of distances between atoms, each row corresponding to an
atom and having a weight as not all atoms are considered equal. The
AMD is the average of the PDD, so :math:`\text{AMD}(S)_{k}` is the average
distance to the :math:`k`-th nearest neighbour over atoms in the unit cell. Both
take a parameter :math:`k`, and all entries up to the :math:`k`-th are given.

The full construction of PDD is as follows: 1) List distances to the nearest :math:`k`
neighbours in order for each atom in a unit cell; 2) Collect into rows of a matrix
and order the rows lexicographically; 3) If any rows are the same, merge into one
and assign weights to each row proportional to their frequency (in implementation,
these weights are in the first column of the PDD).

Comparing by AMD/PDD
********************

AMDs are just vectors which can be compared with any metric, as long as k is the same. 
The default metric used in this package is L-infinity (aka Chebyshev), 
since it does not so much accumulate differences in distances across many neighbours. 
PDDs are matrices with weighted rows; the appropriate metric to compare them is the `Earth mover's distance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mover%27s_distance>`_ (aka Wasserstein metric), 
which itself needs a metric to compare two PDD rows (without their weights), where L-infinity is again the default.
