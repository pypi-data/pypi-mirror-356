Analyze the following git diff for the directory `{{ group_name }}` and generate a detailed semantic release commit message.
Format the output as:
1. A summary title in semantic release format (type(scope): summary) â€” scope can be the directory or 'root'.
2. A short summary paragraph if needed.
3. Bullet points listing the main changes, grouped as 'New Features', 'Enhancements & Refinements', and 'Bug Fixes' if relevant. Use bold for feature/section names.
Output only the commit message, don't include explanations or extra text.
