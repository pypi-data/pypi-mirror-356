from aspose.html import *
from aspose.html.converters import *
from aspose.html.saving import *

# Setup directories
output_folder = "output/"
input_folder = "data/"
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)

# Prepare an HTML code and save it to the file
code = "<h1>Header 1</h1>" \
         "<h2>Header 2</h2>" \
         "<p>Hello World!!</p>"
document_path = os.path.join(input_folder, 'document.html')
output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, 'output.md')
with open(document_path, 'w', encoding="utf-8") as f:
         f.write(code)
         f.close()
         # Call convert_html method to convert HTML to Markdown.
         Converter.convert_html(document_path, MarkdownSaveOptions.git, output_path)
```
