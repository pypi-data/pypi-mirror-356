## Setup

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install league-mcp-server
```

#### Option 2: Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/League-MCP.git
cd League-MCP/mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

1. Set your Riot API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   RIOT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Run the server:

   ### Transport Options
   
   The server supports two transport types for different integration scenarios:
   
   #### stdio (Default) - For the provided MCP client and Claude Desktop Integration
   ```bash
   league-mcp-server
   # or explicitly
   league-mcp-server --transport stdio
   ```
   
   #### sse - For Web-Based Integrations  
   ```bash
   league-mcp-server --transport sse
   ```
   
   ### Transport Details
   
   - **stdio**: Standard input/output transport
     - Used for direct integration with MCP clients like Claude Desktop
     - Processes requests via stdin and responds via stdout
     - Default option for most use cases
   
   - **sse**: Server-Sent Events transport
     - Used for web-based integrations and HTTP connections
     - Provides real-time communication over HTTP
     - Suitable for web applications and browser-based clients
   
   ### Command Line Help
   ```bash
   league-mcp-server --help
   ```

   ### Development Mode
   
   If you're developing or running from source:
   ```bash
   python main.py [--transport {stdio,sse}]
   ```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture:

- **Services**: Handle external API communication and business logic
- **Utils**: Provide formatting and helper functions  
- **Primitives**: Define MCP tools, resources, and prompts organized by functionality
  - **Tools**: API endpoint wrappers (35+ tools across 10 APIs)
  - **Resources**: Static data access (Data Dragon, game constants)
  - **Prompts**: Workflow automation and analysis guides
- **Main**: Entry point that registers all components and starts the server

Each API endpoint category is separated into its own file with a registration function that adds all related tools to the MCP server.

## Compliance & Best Practices

This server implements Riot Games API best practices:

- **Rate Limiting**: Proper rate limit handling and backoff strategies
- **Security**: API key protection and HTTPS-only communication
- **Tournament Policies**: Full compliance with tournament organization requirements
- **Data Usage**: Adherence to Riot's developer API policies
- **Routing**: Correct platform and regional routing for optimal performance
