# Animated Text Display Specification

## 1. Purpose
To enhance the user experience by implementing a default typewriter-style text animation for all `rich` boxes, simulating the real-time token generation of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 2. Functional Requirements
- Any text content rendered within a `rich.box.Box` or similar `rich` container must be displayed with a character-by-character animation.
- The animation speed should be configurable, with a sensible default value.
- A global override switch (e.g., an environment variable or a configuration setting) must be provided to disable the animation for users who prefer instant text display.
- The animation should not block the main execution thread, especially during long text rendering.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements / Constraints
- **Performance**: The animation must be lightweight and should not introduce noticeable performance overhead.
- **Usability**: The animation speed should be fast enough to avoid frustrating users but slow enough to be aesthetically pleasing.
- **Consistency**: The effect should be applied consistently across all `rich` boxes in the application.

## 4. Implementation Notes
- A utility function, e.g., `animate_text(text: str, panel: rich.panel.Panel)`, should be created to handle the animation logic.
- This function will incrementally update the content of the provided `rich` panel or box.
- Existing calls that render text in boxes should be refactored to use this new utility.
- The animation speed can be controlled by a short `time.sleep()` delay between character appends.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- When a command that displays information in a box is run, the text appears character by character.
- The animation can be disabled via the specified configuration option.
- The application remains responsive during the text animation.

## 6. Future Considerations
- Introduce different animation styles (e.g., word-by-word, fade-in).
- Allow for per-component configuration of animation speed and style.
