# Live Output Component Specification

## 1. Purpose
This specification defines a new live output component for the AutoMake CLI. This component will provide a real-time, updatable box for displaying streaming content, such as AI model token streams and other animations, enhancing the user experience by providing dynamic feedback.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- The component must be a `rich.live` instance that can be updated in real time.
- It should be styled as a box, consistent with the existing `print_box` function.
- The content inside the box must be updatable without redrawing the entire screen.
- It must support streaming text content, specifically for displaying tokens from the LLM as they are generated.
- It should also support other `rich` renderables for animations or dynamic content.
- The component must be integrated into the existing `OutputFormatter` class.

## 3. Non-functional Requirements / Constraints
- **Performance**: The live component should have a configurable refresh rate to balance between smooth animation and performance overhead. Default should be reasonable (e.g., 4 FPS).
- **Thread Safety**: The component must be implemented with thread safety in mind, especially when updating content from different threads (e.g., a background thread for model streaming). The implementation should account for `rich.live`'s own threading limitations.
- **Resource Management**: The `Live` instance must be properly managed as a context manager to ensure it is started and stopped correctly, and terminal state is restored on exit.
- **Fallback**: In non-interactive terminals or environments that do not support live updates, it should gracefully degrade.

## 4. Architecture & Data Flow
- A new class, `LiveBox`, will be created to encapsulate the `rich.live.Live` and `rich.panel.Panel` objects.
- `LiveBox` will be managed by the `OutputFormatter`.
- `OutputFormatter` will expose methods to start, update, and stop the `LiveBox`.
- When streaming tokens, a background thread can accumulate tokens and call an update method on the `LiveBox` instance, which will then refresh its content.
- The `LiveBox` will manage a renderable object (like `rich.text.Text`) that holds the streaming content.

## 5. Implementation Notes
- The `LiveBox` will be initialized with a title and border style, similar to the static `Panel`.
- An internal `threading.Lock` might be necessary within `LiveBox` to handle concurrent updates to its content.
- The `Live` object should be configured with `transient=True` if the box is meant to disappear after its task is complete.
- We will add a method like `start_live_box` to `OutputFormatter` which returns a `LiveBox` context manager.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- A `LiveBox` can be created and displayed via the `OutputFormatter`.
- Streaming text into the `LiveBox` results in a smooth, real-time update of its content.
- The `LiveBox` maintains the visual style of other boxes in the application.
- The application remains stable and does not crash due to threading issues related to the live display.

## 7. Out of Scope
- Complex nested live displays. The initial implementation will focus on a single live box at a time.
- A fully generic live component framework. This will be a specific implementation for a box-like display.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Thread-safety issues with `rich.live` causing visual artifacts or crashes.
  - **Mitigation**: Follow best practices from `rich` documentation, use locks for content updates, and perform thorough testing with concurrent operations.
- **Risk**: Performance degradation due to high refresh rates.
  - **Mitigation**: Make the refresh rate configurable and choose a sensible default.
