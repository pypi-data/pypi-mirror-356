# CI/CD Pipeline Specification

## Purpose
This document defines the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for the AutoMake project. The pipeline automates testing, quality checks, and reporting to ensure code quality and streamline development.

## Functional Requirements
- The pipeline must be triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
- It must install all project dependencies using `uv`.
- It must run the full test suite using `pytest`.
- It must generate a code coverage report using `pytest-cov`.
- It must enforce a minimum code coverage threshold (e.g., 80%).
- It must integrate with GitHub to display test and coverage results directly in pull requests.

## Non-functional Requirements / Constraints
- The pipeline should be defined as code using GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- It should complete in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
- It must securely handle any secrets, if required in the future.

## Architecture & Data Flow
1.  **Trigger**: A `git push` or `pull_request` event on the `main` branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.
2.  **Environment Setup**: The workflow checks out the code and sets up a specific Python version. It installs `uv` and then uses it to install project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
3.  **Testing & Coverage**: The `pytest` command is run to execute all unit and integration tests. A coverage report is generated simultaneously.
4.  **Reporting**: Test results are processed, and a summary is posted to the pull request. The coverage report is uploaded as a workflow artifact.
5.  **Badge Integration**: The pipeline's status (passing/failing) will be used to update a status badge in the `README.md`. A separate service like Codecov or Coveralls could be used to host coverage reports and provide a coverage badge.

## Implementation Notes
- The workflow file will be located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- We will use `pytest-cov` for coverage.
- For pull request comments and checks, we can use existing GitHub Actions like `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-python@v5`, and potentially others for reporting.
- Badges will be sourced from `shields.io`, pointing to the GitHub Actions workflow status.

## Deployment Strategy & Environments
This pipeline is for CI (Continuous Integration) and does not handle deployment. Deployment is handled via `uvx` as specified in `specs/07-packaging-and-distribution.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new pull request shows the CI pipeline running automatically.
- The pipeline successfully runs tests and reports coverage.
- A failed test run causes the pipeline to fail and blocks the PR from merging (if branch protection rules are set).
- The `README.md` file contains a status badge that reflects the latest pipeline run on the `main` branch.

## Out of Scope
- Continuous Deployment (CD) to a package repository like PyPI.
- Automated dependency updates.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Flaky tests causing pipeline failures.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce strict standards for writing reliable, non-flaky tests.
- **Risk**: Pipeline becomes too slow over time.
  - **Mitigation**: Regularly review job execution times and optimize slow steps. Consider parallelizing jobs if needed.

## Future Considerations
- Integrate a linter (like Ruff) into the pipeline.
- Use a tool like `Codecov` or `Coveralls` for more advanced coverage analysis and reporting.
- Add a job for building and publishing the package to a repository.
