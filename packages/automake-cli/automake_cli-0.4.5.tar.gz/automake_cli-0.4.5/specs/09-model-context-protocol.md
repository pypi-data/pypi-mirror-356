# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for integrating the `automake` tool with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). The primary goal is to enable Large Language Models, particularly within environments like Cursor, to discover and utilize `automake`'s capabilities autonomously.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- The tool must expose its functionality in a way that is compliant with the MCP specification.
- It should broadcast its capabilities, including available `Makefile` targets and command structures.
- It must be able to receive and process requests formatted according to MCP.

## 3. Architecture & Data Flow
- A dedicated module will be responsible for handling MCP communication.
- This module will interface with the core `automake` logic to retrieve `Makefile` contents and execute commands.
- The MCP endpoint will be designed to be lightweight and responsive.

## 4. Implementation Notes
- Research and adhere to the latest version of the Anthropic Model Context Protocol specification.
- Initial implementation will focus on read-only discovery of `make` targets.
- Subsequent phases will enable command execution via MCP.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- A compliant LLM (e.g., in a test environment) can successfully list the available `make` targets by querying the MCP endpoint.
- The LLM can format a valid `automake` command based on the discovered context.

## 6. Out of Scope
- Full implementation of a custom LLM client. The focus is on exposing the MCP-compliant interface.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: The MCP specification may evolve.
- **Mitigation**: Build the integration with modularity to allow for easy updates to the protocol handlers.

## 8. Future Considerations
- Support for more advanced MCP features as they become available.
- Bi-directional communication, allowing `automake` to proactively send information to the LLM.
