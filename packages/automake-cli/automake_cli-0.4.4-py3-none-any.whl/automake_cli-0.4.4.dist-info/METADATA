              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

![AutoMake Help Command](./docs/help_cmd.png)

---

**automake** is a Python-based, agent-first command-line tool that uses a powerful multi-agent system to interpret your natural language commands and execute them.

Forget remembering complex flags or exact `Makefile` targets. Just tell `automake` what you want to do.

## ✨ Key Features
- **AI-Native Commands**: Run terminal commands, execute `Makefile` targets, and perform other tasks using plain English.
- **Multi-Agent System**: A sophisticated `ManagerAgent` orchestrates a team of specialists (Terminal, Coding, Web, Makefile) to get the job done right.
- **Interactive Agent Mode**: Launch a chat session with `automake agent` for complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Local First**: Integrates with local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for privacy and offline access.
- **Intelligent Error Handling**: If you make a typo, the agent will analyze the error and suggest a correction.
- **User-Friendly & Configurable**: A clean CLI and a simple `config.toml` file for all your settings.

## ⚙️ How It Works
`automake` puts an AI agent at the heart of your command line, following a modern, agentic workflow:

1.  **Parse Prompt**: The CLI captures your natural language instruction (e.g., `automake "list all python files"`).
2.  **Invoke Agent**: Your prompt is sent directly to a central **Manager Agent**.
3.  **Reason & Delegate**: The agent analyzes your request and decides which specialist is best for the job—the `TerminalAgent` for shell commands, the `MakefileAgent` for `make` targets, etc.
4.  **Execute & Observe**: The specialist agent executes the task, and the result is observed.
5.  **Stream Output**: The results are streamed directly to your terminal in real-time.

This entire workflow is triggered by the `run` command. For example: `automake run "list all python files"`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for installation)
- An active [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) server with a running model (e.g., `ollama run qwen3:0.6b`).

### Installation

There are several ways to install and run `automake`.

#### Recommended: `uv tool install`
For a permanent installation, we recommend using `uv tool install`. This makes the `automake` command available globally in a dedicated environment.

**1. From Git (Bleeding Edge)**
Install the very latest version directly from this repository:
```bash
# Install the latest version from the main branch
uv tool install git+https://github.com/biokraft/auto-make.git

# You can also install a specific tag or branch
uv tool install git+https://github.com/biokraft/auto-make.git@v0.4.4
```

**2. From PyPI (Stable)**
Install the latest stable release from PyPI:
```bash
uv tool install automake-cli
```

#### Temporary Execution: `uvx`
If you prefer not to install the tool, you can run it directly using `uvx` (similar to `npx`). This downloads and runs the package in a temporary environment.
```bash
uvx automake-cli run "your command here"
```

#### Traditional `pip`
You can also use `pip` for a standard installation:
```bash
pip install automake-cli
```

### First-Time Setup
After installation, run the initialization command once to set up Ollama and download the required model:
```bash
automake init
```
This command will:
- Verify that Ollama is installed and running.
- Download the configured LLM model if not already available.
- Ensure everything is ready for natural language command interpretation.

## ✍️ Usage

### Non-Interactive Commands
The primary way to use `automake` is with the `run` command, passing your request as a string argument:

```bash
# Run a terminal command
automake run "recursively find all files named README.md"

# Execute a Makefile target
automake run "run the tests and generate a coverage report"

# Build the project
automake run "build the project"
```

### Interactive Agent Session
For more complex tasks, start a chat with the agent:
```bash
automake agent
```

For detailed usage information and available options, run:
```bash
automake help
```

## 🛠️ Configuration
`automake` features a modern, user-friendly configuration system. On first run, it creates a `config.toml` file in your user configuration directory.

### Setting the AI Model
Configure your preferred Ollama model:
```bash
# Set a specific model
automake config set ollama.model "qwen2.5:7b"

# After changing the model, initialize it
automake init
```

**Important**: After changing the model, you must run `automake init` to download and initialize the new model if it's not already available locally.

### View and Modify Configuration
- **View current config**: `automake config show`
- **Set specific values**: `automake config set <section.key> <value>`
- **Edit manually**: `automake config edit`
- **Reset to defaults**: `automake config reset`

### Common Configuration Examples
```bash
# Set the AI model
automake config set ollama.model "qwen3:8b"

# Set the Ollama server URL
automake config set ollama.base_url "http://localhost:11434"

# Set logging level
automake config set logging.level "DEBUG"

# Set AI interaction threshold
automake config set ai.interactive_threshold 90
```

### Configuration Structure
Run `automake config show` to see the current configuration.
```toml
# Example from automake config show
[ollama]
base_url = "http://localhost:11434"
model = "qwen3:0.6b"

[logging]
level = "INFO"

[ai]
interactive_threshold = 80
```

## 🎬 Demos
Want to see some UI/UX demos?
Just run `uv run make demo-all`
or use automake: `automake run "show all demos"`

> **Note:** Running demos with automake may cause animation display issues. For the best demo experience, use the direct `uv run make demo-all` command.
