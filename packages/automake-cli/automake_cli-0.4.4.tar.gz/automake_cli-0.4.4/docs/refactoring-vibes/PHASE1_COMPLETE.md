# Phase 1 Complete: Scaffolding

## Summary

Phase 1 of the AutoMake refactoring has been successfully completed. The new directory structure has been created without breaking any existing functionality.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. New Directory Structure Created
```
automake/
├── cli/
│   ├── commands/          # NEW: Individual command modules
│   ├── display/           # NEW: Display and presentation logic
│   └── app.py             # NEW: Main Typer app structure
├── config_new/            # NEW: Configuration management (renamed to avoid conflicts)
├── logging_new/           # NEW: Logging setup and handlers (renamed to avoid conflicts)
├── utils/
│   └── output_new/        # NEW: Refactored output utilities (renamed to avoid conflicts)
└── resources/             # NEW: Consolidated resources
    └── ascii_art.txt      # MOVED: From duplicate locations
```

### 2. Placeholder Files Created
All new modules have been created with:
- Proper docstrings explaining their purpose
- TODO comments outlining what will be moved during Phase 2 and 3
- Appropriate `__init__.py` files with planned exports (commented out)

### 3. Import Conflicts Resolved
- Temporarily renamed new directories (`config_new`, `logging_new`, `output_new`) to avoid Python import conflicts
- This allows existing code to continue working while new structure is being built

### 4. Resources Consolidated
- Moved `ascii_art.txt` to central `resources/` directory
- Eliminated duplication between root and CLI directories

### 5. CLI App Structure Prepared
- Created `cli/app.py` with basic Typer app structure
- Set up command groups for logs and config
- Added placeholder callbacks for version and help

## Verification

✅ **All tests passing**: 353 tests passed
✅ **CLI functionality intact**: `python -m automake --version` works
✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing imports and functionality preserved

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Move configuration management from `config.py` to `config_new/`
2. Move logging setup from `logging_setup.py` to `logging_new/`
3. Split `utils/output.py` into `utils/output_new/` modules
4. Update imports gradually to maintain backward compatibility
5. Rename directories back to their final names once migration is complete

## File Status

### New Files Created (16 files)

### Existing Files Unchanged
All existing functionality remains intact and operational.
