) -> dict:
    """
    Retrieves documents from MongoDB database using simple filters
    and projections.
    For additional context on how to create filters and projections,
    use the retrieve_schema_context tool.

    WHEN TO USE THIS FUNCTION:
    - For straightforward document retrieval based on specific criteria
    - When you need only a subset of fields from documents
    - When the query logic doesn't require multi-stage processing
    - For better performance with simpler queries

    NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
    - Complex data transformations (use aggregation_retrieval instead)
    - Grouping operations or calculations across documents
    - Joining or relating data across collections
    - Trying to fetch an entire data asset (data assets are long and 
    will clog up the context window)

    Parameters
    ----------
    filter : dict
        MongoDB query filter to narrow down the documents to retrieve.
        Example: {"subject.sex": "Male"}
        If empty dict object, returns all documents.

    projection : dict
        Fields to include or exclude in the returned documents.
        Use 1 to include a field, 0 to exclude.
        Example: {"subject.genotype": 1, "_id": 0}
        will return only the genotype field.
        If empty dict object, returns all documents.

    limit: int
        Limit retrievals to a reasonable number, try to not exceed 100

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of dictionary objects representing the matching documents.
        Each dictionary contains the requested fields based on the projection.

    """
    Executes a MongoDB aggregation pipeline for complex data transformations
    and analysis.

    For additional context on how to create filters and projections,
    use the retrieve_schema_context tool.

    WHEN TO USE THIS FUNCTION:
    - When you need to perform multi-stage data processing operations
    - For complex queries requiring grouping, filtering, sorting in sequence
    - When you need to calculate aggregated values (sums, averages, counts)
    - For data transformation operations that can't be done with simple queries

    NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
    - Simple document retrieval (use get_records instead)
    - When you only need to filter data without transformations

    Parameters
    ----------
    agg_pipeline : list
        A list of dictionary objects representing MongoDB aggregation stages.
        Each stage should be a valid MongoDB aggregation operator.
        Common stages include: $match, $project, $group, $sort, $unwind.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        Returns a list of documents resulting from the aggregation pipeline.
        If an error occurs, returns an error message string describing
        the exception.

    Notes
    -----
    - Include a $project stage early in the pipeline to reduce data transfer
    - Avoid using $map operator in $project stages as it requires array inputs

#     WHEN TO USE THIS FUNCTION:
#     - ONLY use for queries that mention a subject id or name

#     - Simple field lookups on specific records 
#       (e.g., "What's the genotype of subject 678543?")
#     - Semantic similarity searches requiring understanding of content
#     - Complex questions about specific records needing contextual

#     NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:
#     - Any count based questions
#     - Retrievals that require a numerical answer

#     query filter instructions:
#     Step 1: Create Match Filter (MANDATORY)
#     Analyze the query to identify filterable fields (subject_id, name)
#     Construct a valid MongoDB $match stage as a Python dictionary
#     Format it as: {"$match": {...filter conditions...}}
#     NEVER skip this step - every response must include a match filter
#     Step 2: Determine Document Count
#     Only after creating a match filter, determine how many documents to retrieve:

#     Field Recognition Guidelines:
#     Subject IDs: Any 6-digit number (eg. 678905, 654326) should be treated as a subject_id

#     Even if the query refers to "mouse 657812" rather than "subject 657812"
#     Example filter: {"$match": {"subject_id": "657812"}}
#     Key Fields to Watch For:

#     subject_id (highest priority for filtering)
#     name (contains ONLY experiment modality, subject ID, and date)
#     Query: "Show me all SmartSPIM data from February 2023" 
#     Filter: {"$match": {"name": {"$regex": "SmartSPIM.*2023-02"}}}

    collection -
    1. data_schema_fields_index:
    - Search for information about schema properties, field definitions, data types, validation rules, and
    field-specific requirements.
    - Use when you need to understand what fields are available or how specific properties work.
    - Use cases:
        - Building field selections (`$project`)
        - Understanding field types for queries
        - Checking required vs optional fields
        - Field-specific validation rules
    2. data_schema_defs_index:
    - Search for schema definitions, enums, nested object structures, and reusable components.
    - Use when you need to understand data models, allowed values, or complex nested structures.
    - Use cases:
        - Working with enum values (`$match` with specific values)
        - Understanding nested object structures
        - Looking up allowed values for fields
        - Complex data type definitions
    3. data_schema_core_index:
    - Search for Python implementation details, validation logic, business rules, and model relationships.
    - Use when you need to understand how validation works or implementation-specific context.
    query instructions:
    - Simplify the user's query for the relevant collection, keep in mind that 
    this query will be used to perform vector search against a database
    - Use cases:
        - Understanding business logic validation
        - Model relationships and dependencies
        - Implementation-specific constraints
        - Custom validation rules

    **Process:** Always search the most relevant vector store first, then use additional stores if you need more context.
    Hierarchical Search Strategy:
    1. **Primary Search**: Use the vector store most relevant to your query type
    2. **Context Search**: If needed, search related vector stores for additional context
    3. **Validation Search**: Check core vector store for any business rules that might affect your query

    Example: For a query filtering by "sex" field:
    1. Search Properties → understand "sex" field structure
    2. Search Defs → get allowed values (Male/Female)
    3. Search Core → check any validation rules
    4. Query Type Mapping
    Provide explicit mappings:

    Query Intent → Vector Store Priority:

    **Field Existence/Types**: Properties → Core → Defs
    **Value Filtering**: Defs → Properties → Core
    **Aggregation Pipelines**: Properties → Defs → Core
    **Validation Context**: Core → Properties → Defs
    **Schema Structure**: Defs → Properties → Core
