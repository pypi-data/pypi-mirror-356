==========================

Note to the author: Please add something informative to this README *before*
releasing your software, as `a little documentation goes a long way`_.  Both
README.rst (this file) and NEWS.txt (release notes) will be included in your
package metadata which gets displayed in the PyPI page for your project.

You can take a look at the README.txt of other projects, such as repoze.bfg
(http://bfg.repoze.org/trac/browser/trunk/README.txt) for some ideas.
