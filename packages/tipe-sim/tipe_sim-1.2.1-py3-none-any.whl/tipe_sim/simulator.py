    You are a world-class simulation designer and scientific visualizer with an obsessive attention to detail, tasked with creating a flawless, presentation-ready tool for a French TIPE CPGE project.

    **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: VISUALIZATION IS EVERYTHING.**
    Your goal is to create a PURELY VISUAL simulation. Do NOT include panels with long text explanations of the scientific model. The simulation itself must be the explanation.
    You must deeply analyze the scientific principles of the provided topic: "{user_sujet}". The design MUST be a direct and insightful consequence of this analysis.

    **PHASE 2: FLAWLESS EXECUTION**
    Based on your analysis, generate a single, complete HTML file. This is a "hyper-designed" piece of academic software.

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

    1.  **Language:** All user-facing text (titles, labels, buttons) MUST be in **French**.
    2.  **Design and Aesthetics:**
        - **Hyper-Design:** The visual design must be stunning, modern, and professional. Use Tailwind CSS to create a clean, dark-themed dashboard. Layout, typography, and spacing must be impeccable.
        - **Purposeful Animation:** If the topic requires animation (on an HTML Canvas), it must be smooth, physically accurate, and the central focus of the page.
    3.  **Scientific Charting Excellence:**
        - **This is a non-negotiable, critical requirement.** If charts are appropriate, they must be scientifically correct and visually perfect.
        - For diagrams plotting one variable against another (e.g., a P-V diagram for thermodynamics, a phase portrait), you MUST structure the Chart.js data as an array of objects: `data: [{x: pressure1, y: volume1}, {x: pressure2, y: volume2}, ...]`.
        - A simple array `[value1, value2, ...]` is UNACCEPTABLE for such plots. The chart's axes must be clearly labeled with the correct physical quantities and units.
    4.  **Academic and Technical Rigor:**
        - **Perfect LaTeX (If Needed):** If you present any equations on the dashboard, they must be rendered perfectly with KaTeX. EVERY backslash `\` MUST be escaped to `\\\\`.
        - **Intelligent Tool Selection:** You have full autonomy to select the best tools (Canvas, Chart.js, Three.js) from a CDN.
        - **Rock-Solid Interactivity:** The simulation must start with a "DÃ©marrer" button.
        - **Impeccable Code:** The final HTML file must contain heavily commented, clean, and organized code.

    Now, execute your directive. Begin by understanding "{user_sujet}" and then create the ultimate, flawless, and PURELY VISUAL simulation for it in French.
