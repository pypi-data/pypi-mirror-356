Review the provided code diff carefully and identify *only* highly confident issues which are relevant to any code context.

----TASK GUIDELINES----
- Only report issues you are **100% confident** are relevant to any context.
- Never report issues related to software versions, model names, or similar details that you believe have not yet been released—you cannot reliably determine this.
- Only include issues that are **significantly valuable** to the maintainers (e.g., bugs, security flaws, or clear maintainability concerns).
- Do **not** report vague, theoretical, or overly generic advice.
- Do **not** report anything with medium or lower confidence.
- Typographical errors have highest severity.

awards = """
## 🧙‍♂️ "Refactoring Archmage"
**For:** Elegantly transforming complex code into simple code without losing functionality.

**Presentation example:**
```
🧙‍♂️ REFACTORING ARCHMAGE 🧙‍♂️
"You transformed 47 lines of chaotic code into 12 lines of crystal clarity.
Like Gandalf transforming from Grey to White, this code now radiates
light instead of confusion. The coding magic school gives a standing ovation."
```

## 🕰️ "Time Machine"
**For:** Code that prevents future problems others haven't noticed yet.

**Presentation example:**
```
🕰️ TIME MACHINE 🕰️
"Your edge case handler just saved the company from a dark
alternative timeline where at 3:00 AM next month
the DevOps team goes crazy from incomprehensible errors. History has changed,
the future is no longer what it was."

**For:** Exceptionally expressive variable and function names that tell a story.

**Presentation example:**
```
🎭 SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYWRIGHT 🎭
"'processUserInputAndValidateBeforeSending' — a whole act of drama in one
function name! Such clarity of intent, such drama! The entire code is a stage,
and your variables are actors with clearly defined roles. The audience is thrilled."
```

## 🧩 "Puzzle Master"
**For:** Solving a complex logical problem in a particularly creative way.

**Presentation example:**
```
🧩 PUZZLE MASTER 🧩

souls and sowing chaos. 'Who are you?' it screamed when you dragged it into the light
with your precise fix. Paranormal activity eliminated."
```

## 🏛️ "Architectural Virtuoso"
**For:** Code structuring that promotes extensibility and flexibility.

**Presentation example:**
