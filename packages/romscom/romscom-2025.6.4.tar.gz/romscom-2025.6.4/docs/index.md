## Introduction

This site contains the project documentation for the ROMS Communication Toolbox (romscom). This python toolbox provides tools to communicate with the [Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)](https://github.com/myroms/roms) model.  The primary goal of this toolbox is to allow ROMS simulations to be run programmatically, simplifying tasks such as resetting time variables to extend or restart simulations, running parameter sensitivity studies, or running large ensembles.  This also allows for the creation of a clearly documented and reproducible workflow.
