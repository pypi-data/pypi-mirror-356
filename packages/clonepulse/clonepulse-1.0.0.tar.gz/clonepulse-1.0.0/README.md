## What is ClonePulse?

`ClonePulse` is a GitHub-friendly toolchain that fetches, tracks, and visualizes repository clone activity.

It offers:

- **Daily clone tracking** (total + unique)
- **12-week visual dashboard** (.PNG image)
- **Automatic milestone detection** (e.g., 500, 1K, 2K+ clones)
- **Auto-annotations** for clone spikes
  - Annotations can be manually added to `clonepulse/fetch_clones.json` (for example date of post on reddit)
- **Badge generation** for README inclusion
- **GitHub Actions** support for automation

## üì∑ Example dashboard

> A weekly clone activity chart is automatically updated and saved in `doc/weekly_clones.png`.

It is intended to run every Monday morning. Data from the current week is discarded - only data for full weeks are shown.

## üîê Create GitHub Token for ClonePulse

ClonePulse fetches traffic (clone) stats from the GitHub API. This requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with read-only access to `Read access to administration and metadata`. Here's how to create one securely and use it with GitHub Actions.

### Token Requirements

For public repositories, a fine-grained token with `Read access to administration and metadata` access is sufficient.

For private repositories, you will also need:

- Repository contents: Read-only
- Repository metadata: Read-only
- Repository traffic: Read-only

### How to Create a Fine-Grained Token

Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Fine-grained token"

Configure:

Name: e.g., `"your repository"_ClonePulse`

Expiration: e.g., 90 days

Resource owner: Your user or organization

Repository access: Select the **specific repo**

Set the following permissions on the token:

- "Administration": Read-only
- "Metadata":  Read-only
- For Private repos you might need more.....

Click "Generate token" and copy the value of the token to secure storage immediately. You only see it once.

## Use the token in your repository

After having created the secret, you must now put it into the repository where you want to use it.

1. Go to your GitHub repository:  
   **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret**

2. Name the secret:  
   `CLONEPULSE_METRICS`

3. Paste the token you copied and save.

The workflow references the secret as an environment variable in this way:

```yaml
- name: Run fetch_clones.py
  env:
    TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLONEPULSE_METRICS }}
  run: python src/clonepulse/fetch_clones.py
```

## How to drop the essentials into another repository

Create a tarball with the needed artifacts as shown below and extract the contents into your repository of choice.

Your destination repository must be somewhere on disk in a local git repo.

Take a look at SETUP.md also.

```bash
# create tarball with
#  - 2 .github workflows
#  - artifacts in clonepulse/
#  - the python scripts in src/clonepulse/
tar --exclude='.github/workflows/py-tests.yml' \
    --exclude='clonepulse/weekly_clones.png' \
    --exclude='*/__pycache__' --exclude='*.pyc' \
    -cvf clonepulse-artifacts.tar \
    {src/clonepulse,clonepulse,.github/workflows}

# extract artifacts to destination repo 
tar -xvf clonepulse-artifacts.tar -C <your repo>
```

After extraction, ensure that:

  clonepulse/ and src/clonepulse/ exist in your repo root

  GitHub Actions are in .github/workflows/

## Installation (dev setup)

These instructions are only needed if you want to hack on ClonePulse

```bash
# python3 and a few packages are needed.
# This works on Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-venv python3-pip

git clone https://github.com/your-user/clonepulse.git
cd clonepulse
./build.sh  # Creates virtualenv and installs dependencies
```

This sets up a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies listed in pyproject.toml.
