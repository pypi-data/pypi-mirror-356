Peak-Finder-App
===============
**peak-finder-app** is a package for the detection and grouping of time-domain
electromagnetic (TEM) anomalies measured along flight lines.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Online documentation <https://mirageoscience-peak-finder-app.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**peak-finder-app** is currently written for Python 3.10 or higher.


Install Conda
-------------

To install **peak-finder-app**, you need to install **Conda** first.

We recommend to install **Conda** using `miniforge`_.

.. _miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Quick installation
-------------------

To install (or re-install) a conda environment to run **peak-finder-app**, simply execute the **install.bat** file.

To install in editable mode, so that changes in the source code are immediately reflected in the
running application, execute with the ``-e`` option: ``install.bat -e``
(in editable mode, the source folder must not be moved or deleted after installation).


Manual installation
-------------------

You should not install the package directly with ``pip``, as the app requires conda packages to run.

First create a Conda environment with all the required dependencies,
then activate it and install the package in this environment using
``pip install --no-deps ...``

See instructions below for more details and options.

Prepare a Conda environment with dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can create a Conda environment with all the required dependencies ``conda`` and the ``.lock``
files from a conda prompt::

    $ conda env create --solver libmamba -n my-env -f environments/[the_desired_env].lock.yml

.. note::
    The package itself is not install yet in the Conda environment. See following instructions.

.. warning::
    All the following ``pip`` commands are meant to be executed in the Conda environment you just created.
    Activate it with::

    $ conda activate my-env

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

To install the **peak-finder-app** package published on PyPI::

    $ pip install --no-deps -U peak-finder-app

From a Git tag or branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the revision of the package is not on PyPI yet, you can install it from a Git tag::

    $ pip install --no-deps -U --force-reinstall https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/peak-finder-app/archive/refs/tags/TAG.zip

Or to install the latest changes available on a given Git branch::

    $ pip install --no-deps -U --force-reinstall https://github.com/MiraGeoscience/peak-finder-app/archive/refs/heads/BRANCH.zip

.. note::
    The ``--force-reinstall`` option is used to make sure the updated version
    of the sources is installed, and not the cached version, even if the version number
    did not change.

    The ``-U`` or ``--upgrade`` option is used to make sure to get the latest version,
    on not merely reinstall the same version.

    The option ``--no-deps`` is used to avoid installing the dependencies with pip,
    as they have dependencies are already installed within the **Conda environment**.

From a local copy of the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have a git clone of the package sources locally, you can install **peak-finder-app** from the
local copy of the sources. At the root of the sources, you will find a ``pyproject.toml`` file.

Change directory to the root of the sources::

    $ cd path/to/project_folder_with_pyproject_toml

Then run::

    $ pip install --no-deps -U --force-reinstall .

Or in **editable mode**, so that you can edit the sources and see the effect immediately at runtime::

    $ pip install --no-deps -U --force-reinstall -e .
