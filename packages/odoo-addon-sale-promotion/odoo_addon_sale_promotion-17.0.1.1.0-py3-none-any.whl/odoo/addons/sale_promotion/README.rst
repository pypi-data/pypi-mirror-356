Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to Sales > Products >
Promotions and create a new promotion. Create as many price rules as
needed, considering the following fields:

1. **Computation:** Select "Fixed Price" as the computation method and
   set a value in the "Fixed Price" field so that value will be set as
   the unit price in sale orders if that rule is applied. Select
   "Discount" as the computacion method and set a value in the
   "Discount" field so that value will be set as the discount in sale
   orders if that rule is applied.
2. **Apply On:** Select "All Products" if the price or the discount can
   be applied to all products. Select "Product Category" and choose a
   category if the price or the discount can applied to products of a
   given category. Select "Product" and choose a product template if the
   price or the discount can be applied to a given product template.
   Select "Product Variant" and choose a product variant if the price or
   the discount can applied to a given product variant.
3. **Min. Quantity:** The rule can only be applied if the quantity is
   equal or greater than the set value.
4. **Validity:** The rule can only be applied if the date order is
   inbetween the selected dates.

Once a promotion is created, it is necessary to create a Campaign (Sales
> Products > Campaigns).

1. **Start Date:** Select a date if the promotion can only be applied
   from that date.
2. **End Date:** Select a date if the promotion can only be applied
   before that date.
3. **Pricelists:** Select the list of pricelists for which the campaign
   is available. The campaign will only be applied to a sale order if
   the order's pricelist is selected in this field.
4. **Promotions:** Select the list of promotions that are part of the
   campaign.

Usage
=====

There are two ways to apply promotions in sale orders:

1. Click on the "Apply Promotion" button under the sale order lines to
   apply promotions to all the lines if possible.
2. Click on the "Apply Promotion" in an order line to apply promotions
   to that specific order line if possible.

Promotions are only applied when the resulting price is lower than the
price already set in the sale order line. Only one rule can be applied
in each sale order line.
