There are two ways to apply promotions in sale orders:

1.  Click on the "Apply Promotion" button under the sale order lines to apply
	promotions to all the lines if possible.
2.  Click on the "Apply Promotion" in an order line to apply promotions to that
	specific order line if possible.

Promotions are only applied when the resulting price is lower than the price
already set in the sale order line. Only one rule can be applied in each sale
order line.
