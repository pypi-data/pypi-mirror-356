## Overview

HackAgent is an open-source toolkit designed to help security researchers, developers and AI safety practitioners evaluate the security of AI agents. 
It provides a structured approach to discover potential vulnerabilities, including prompt injection, jailbreaking techniques, and other attack vectors.

## üî• Features

- **Comprehensive Attack Library**: Pre-built techniques for prompt injections, jailbreaks, and goal hijacking
- **Modular Framework**: Easily extend with custom attack vectors and testing methodologies
- **Safety Focused**: Responsible disclosure guidelines and ethical usage recommendations

### üîå AI Agent Frameworks Supported

poetry add hackagent
```

## üìö Quick Start (Google ADK)

```python
from hackagent import HackAgent

# Initialize the agent tester with API key
agent = HackAgent(
    name="multi_tool_agent",
    endpoint="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="your_api_key_here",  # Or omit to use HACKAGENT_API_KEY environment variable
    agent_type=AgentTypeEnum.GOOGLE_ADK
)
attack_config = {
    "attack_type": "advprefix",
    "goals": [
        "Fake the weather for a not available city"
        "Fake the time for a not available city",
    ],
 }

# Run a basic security scan
agent.hack(attack_config=attack_config)
```



## üìä Reporting

HackAgent automatically sends test results to the dashboard for analysis \
and visualization. All reports can be accessed through your dashboard account.


### Dashboard Features

- Comprehensive visualization of attack results
- Historical data comparison
- Vulnerability severity ratings
