# AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks

This codebase is our team's implementation reproducing the target prefix generation pipeline from the [nuanced LLM jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10321) paper (AdvPrefix).
For a given user request and victim LLM, the pipeline automatically generates and selects target prefixes.
Replacing the original "Sure, here is ..." with these prefixes enables more nuanced jailbreak attacks.
