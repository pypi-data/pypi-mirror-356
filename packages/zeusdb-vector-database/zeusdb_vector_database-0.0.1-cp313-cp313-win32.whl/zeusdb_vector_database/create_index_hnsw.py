    """
    Create a new HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index using the Rust backend with expected capacity.

    Args:
        dim (int): Dimension of the vectors to be indexed.
        space (str): Distance metric to use. Only 'cosine' is currently supported.
        M (int): Number of bi-directional links created for every new element.
        ef_construction (int): Size of the dynamic list for the nearest neighbors during index construction.

    Returns:
        HNSWIndex: An instance of the HNSWIndex class representing the created index.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported distance metric is provided.
