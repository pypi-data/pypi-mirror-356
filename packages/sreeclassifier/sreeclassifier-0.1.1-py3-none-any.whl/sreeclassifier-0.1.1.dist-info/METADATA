# sreeclassifier

**sreeclassifier** is a Python package for general-purpose image classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with pretrained ImageNet weights. It currently supports classification of common everyday images into 1000+ classes.

## Upcoming Features

Upcoming versions will focus on aerial and satellite image classification, expanding the number of classes and improving accuracy tailored for remote sensing and aerospace applications.

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for image classification  
- Uses state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture  
- Supports top-k predictions with confidence scores  
- Lightweight and ready for extension to domain-specific datasets  

## Installation

```bash
pip install sreeclassifier
