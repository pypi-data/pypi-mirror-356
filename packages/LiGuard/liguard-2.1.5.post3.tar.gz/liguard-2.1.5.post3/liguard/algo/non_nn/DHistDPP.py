Discrete Histograms of Distances-Per-Point (D_HistDPP)
=======================================================

It is a background filter for roadside LIDAR "structured" point cloud data. The term "structured", here, means that the point cloud can be represented by a fixed size HXV (horizontal resolution x vertical resolution) matrix. For example, if a LiDAR has a 1024 horizontal and 64 vertical resolution, and outputs a point cloud containing 1024x64 points where each point is from a fixed azimuth and elevation ray, then the point cloud is structured. The algorithm is designed to work with such structured point clouds.

The algorithm is summmarized in the following steps:
Since the point cloud is structured, each point index represents a unique ray in the LIDAR's field of view.

1. So, for each ray, a histogram of distance is calculated across all frames, resulting in N histograms, where N is the number of points in the point cloud.
2. The histograms are then normalized by the number of frames.
3. The normalized histograms are then used to filter out the background points as follows:
    a. For each point index in the query point cloud, the distance of the point is calculated.
    b. The distance is then used to find the bin index in the corresponding histogram (indexed by the same point index).
    c. The density of the bin is then compared with a threshold:
        - If the density is less than the threshold, the point is considered as foreground,
        - otherwise background.
