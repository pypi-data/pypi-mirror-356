"""
pcd Package
===========
This package contains modules responsible for reading and displaying point cloud data. It comprises of three kinds of modules:

1. **file_io.py**: Contains the boilerplate code for reading point cloud files supported by the `open3d` library.
2. **sensor_io.py**: Contains the boilerplate code for reading live stream from LiDAR sensors. This module is experimental.
3. **handler_<manufacturer>_<model>.py**: Contains the handler for reading live stream from a specific LiDAR sensor from a specific manufacturer.

The `file_io.py` and `sensor_io.py` modules should not be modified except for contributions to the framework application logic.

Contributing a New Point Cloud Type:
------------------------------------
If you think that a new point cloud type can be beneficial for a vast majority of users, you can follow the contribution guidelines and add your point cloud type to the `pcd` package as described below.

1. Create a new function named `__read_<pcd_type>__` in the `file_io.py` file.
2. Replace `<pcd_type>` with the specific type of point cloud data (e.g., `velodyne`, `hdf5`, etc.).
3. The function should read the point cloud data from the binary file specified by the absolute path and return it as a NumPy array of shape `(N, 4)`, where `N` is the number of points and `4` represents the features `(x, y, z, intensity)`.

Contributing a New Sensor Stream Handler
----------------------------------------
If you think that a new sensor stream handler can be beneficial for a vast majority of users, you can follow the contribution guidelines and add your handler to the `pcd` package as described below.

1. Create a new Python file named `handler_<manufacturer>_<model>.py` in the `pcd` directory.
2. Replace `<manufacturer>` and `<model>` with the manufacturer and model of the LiDAR sensor.
3. The manufacturer and model are passed, respectively, from `sensors->lidar->manufacturer` and `sensors->lidar->model` in `base_config.yml` and are used to select the appropriate handler.

Sensor Stream Handler File Structure
------------------------------------
The `handler_<manufacturer>_<model>.py` file should contain a class named `Handler` with the following structure:

.. code-block:: python

    class Handler:
        '''
        Args:
            cfg (dict): Configuration dictionary containing sensor information.

        Attributes:
            cfg (dict): Configuration dictionary containing sensor information.
            manufacturer (str): Manufacturer of the LiDAR sensor.
            model (str): Model of the LiDAR sensor.
            serial_no (str): Serial number of the LiDAR sensor.
            hostname (str): Hostname of the LiDAR sensor.
            reader (generator): Generator that yields point cloud data.

        Raises:
            Exception: If fails to connect to the LiDAR sensor or receive point cloud data.
        '''

        def __init__(self, cfg: dict):
            self.cfg = cfg
            
            # Extract sensor information from the configuration dictionary
            self.manufacturer = self.cfg['sensors']['lidar']['manufacturer'].lower()
            self.model = self.cfg['sensors']['lidar']['model'].lower().replace('-', '')
            self.serial_no = self.cfg['sensors']['lidar']['serial_number']
            self.hostname = self.cfg['sensors']['lidar']['hostname']
            
            # Connect to the LiDAR sensor and initialize the reader
            self.reader = self.__get_reader__()  # the reader should be a generator that yields point cloud data in NumPy array format of shape (N, 4)

        def __get_reader__(self):
            # Generator function that yields point cloud data in NumPy array format of shape (N, 4)
            pass

        def close(self):
            # Release the resources associated with the LiDAR sensor
            self.reader.close()
