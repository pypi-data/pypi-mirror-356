# API Documentation

All the Wayland interfaces are available in the [`wayland`](../wayland/index.md) namespace.

`wayland.client` provides additional functionality that is not part of the Wayland protocol itself.

## Wayland Protocol Debugger

A stand alone terminal Wayland protocol debugger is included. This allows you to monitor all requests and events between your application and the Wayland compositor.

This is easy to use in your application. See the [documentation here](client.md#wayland.client.start_debug_server).
