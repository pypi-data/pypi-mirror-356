# Changelog

## v1.0.0 (18th June 2025)

This version replaces the previous experiments with a more formal Wayland class library and stable API. It introduces a more typical design pattern and behaviour, with more explicit and predictable Pythonic usage and less implicit magic.

### Major Changes

- Now exposes a Wayland class library (rather than a library of magic instances).
- Introduces a Wayland protocol debugger. A terminal application providing a TUI to intercept and analyse Wayland protocol messages between your application and the Wayland compositor.
- [Examples](https://python-wayland.org/examples/) are now provided, including a basic top level window.
- Comprehensive [online documentation](https://python-wayland.org)Â is now available.

### Other API Changes
- All non-Wayland protocol APIs are now in `wayland.client`
- `wayland.process_messages()` removed. Use dispatch*
- `wayland.initialise()` removed, no longer required.
- `wayland.get_package_root()` replaced with `wayland.client.package.get_package_root()`
- `wayland.is_wayland` replaced with `wayland.client.is_wayland()`
- Event dispatching is now a similar pattern to `libwayland-client`, using dispatch and dispatch_pending for blocking and non-blocking event dispatching.
- [`wayland.wl_display.dispatch()`](https://python-wayland.org/wayland/wl_display/#wayland.wl_display.dispatch) added.
- [`wayland.wl_display.dispatch_timeout()`](https://python-wayland.org/wayland/wl_display/#wayland.wl_display.dispatch_timeout) added.
- [`wayland.wl_display.dispatch_pending()`](https://python-wayland.org/wayland/wl_display/#wayland.wl_display.dispatch_pending) added.

### General Changes
- No connection is made to the Wayland compositor until either explicitly requested or a method that sends a Wayland message is used.
- Internal Wayland event processing has been improved. There are now multiple event queues with automatic creation of per-thread queues.
- Type hinting now uses the correct `python-wayland` types.
- Type hinting uses less magic to increase compatibility with IDEs.
- Type hint docs cleaned up with better formatting.
- Type hints now have argument descriptions included.

### Fixed
- `array` types in events are now correctly parsed into Python lists.
- Importing the package has consistent behaviour on Wayland and non-Wayland systems.
- Fixed type hints where enums had the wrong type when passed as an argument to a request.
- Fixed protocol error when parsing unicode characters in strings.
