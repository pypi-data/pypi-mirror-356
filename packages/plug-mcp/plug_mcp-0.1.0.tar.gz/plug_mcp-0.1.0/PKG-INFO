# plug_mcp: The Missing Connector for AI

**plug_mcp** is a Python library that provides a simple and efficient way to connect your applications to AI models using the Multi-purpose Cooperative Protocol (MCP). It acts as a wrapper around the `mcp` library, offering a streamlined client interface for seamless integration with various AI providers and transport protocols.

## ✨ Features

- **Simplified Client Interface**: A high-level `MCPClient` for easy interaction with MCP servers.
- **Multi-provider Support**: Out-of-the-box support for Anthropic and OpenAI models.
- **Flexible Transports**: Connect to servers using STDIO, SSE, or Streamable HTTP.
- **Built-in Guardrails**: Protect your application with content filtering, PII masking, and injection detection.
- **Conversation Management**: Easily manage conversation history, context, and persistence.
- **Asynchronous by Design**: Built with `asyncio` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new LLM providers, transports, or guardrails.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install plug_mcp
```

### Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use `plug_mcp` to connect to an MCP server and interact with an AI model:

```python
import asyncio
from plug_mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Connect to a local server using STDIO
    client = MCPClient(llm_provider="anthropic")
    await client.connect("python examples/simple_server/main.py")

    # Start a conversation
    conversation_id = client.start_conversation()
    print(f"Started conversation: {conversation_id}")

    # Send a message and get a response
    response = await client.query("Hello, world!")
    print(f"AI: {response}")

    # Disconnect from the server
    await client.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
