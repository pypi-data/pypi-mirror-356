# (1) Check where we are and where we need to go:
#
current = Path('.').resolve()
root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent

#
# (2) Meson build
#
os.chdir(root)
run(['meson','setup','builddir'])
os.chdir(root / "builddir")
run(['meson','compile'], check=True)

#
# (3) Copy the extension module:
#
# NOTE: This should not work on Windows.
# Probable fix: change the file extension to .dll
