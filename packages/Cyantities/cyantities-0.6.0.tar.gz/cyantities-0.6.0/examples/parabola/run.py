# The compiled model code:
from parasolve import ball_throw_with_friction

# Quantities to work with:
from cyantities import Quantity, Unit

#
# Model definition
# ================
#

t = Quantity(np.linspace(0.0, 6.0), 's')
x0 = Quantity(0.0, 'm')
y0 = Quantity(2.1, 'm')
v = Quantity(145.0, 'km h^-1')
vx0 = np.sin(np.pi/4) * v
vy0 = np.cos(np.pi/4) * v
r = Quantity(75.0, 'mm') / 2.0
cw = Quantity(0.45, '1')
rho = Quantity(0.875, 'g*cm^-3') # baseball
rho_air = Quantity(1.2, 'kg*m^-3')

#
# Model run
# =========
#
x,y = ball_throw_with_friction(t, x0, y0, vx0, vy0, r, cw, rho, rho_air)


#
# Plot the results
# ================
