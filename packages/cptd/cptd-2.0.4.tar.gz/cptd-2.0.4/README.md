CPTD CLI

CPTD CLI is not just a command-line tool.
It is an extensible management platform designed to:

Create custom commands and extensions
Enable command exchange between users
Integrate with external tools and APIs
Automate workflows, reporting, and strategic analysis
Serve as the core engine for any user or graphical interfaces (UI)

Architectural Principles

1. CLI as an Extensible Platform

Every command is just a regular Python file with a defined interface.
You can create your own command in under 5 minutes.

Commands are simple Python modules with minimal structure.
Each command includes a manifest file (name, description, author, version, dependencies).
Developers can use the "cptd newcommand" template to get started instantly.

Commands can be tested and debugged interactively during development using:
  
cptd command --add yourcommand.zip (adds the command to the CLI system - only ZIP)
  
cptd command --del yourcommand  (removes the command)  

This enables rapid prototyping, testing, and cleanup without restarting or rebuilding the system.

Run your command:  

cptd yourcommand  

Run your project:  

cptd yourcommand  

2. Security and Validation  

All commands in the shared repository undergo strict security review.
During installation, CPTD CLI performs automatic checks for forbidden code (e.g., dynamic pip install inside command files).
During publishing to the shared repository, each command undergoes rigorous validation for security, structure, and manifest integrity.
When submitted by the community, commands are moderated and reviewed before inclusion in the official repository.

3. CLI as a Core Engine for UI

It serves as a bridge between graphical environments that use CLI as their core engine.
CPTD CLI acts as the core backend for all present and future interfaces.
All UI components interact with the CLI for logic processing and data operations.

4. Centralized and Decentralized Distribution

Commands can be shared and loaded from shared repositories.
Follows a standardized format for sharing, importing, and distributing CLI commands.

5. Autonomy and Reliability

Works fully offline — no cloud required.
No telemetry, no hidden data collection, no external connections.
Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Why It Matters

Flexibility: Adapt CLI to any workflow — from license checks to automation.
Scalability: From solo developers to enterprise teams.
Extensibility: Build, share, moderate, and integrate custom commands.
Security: Strict validation at all stages — installation, execution, and repository submission.
Transparency: All code is open, modular, and auditable.

6. Open Source and Public Repository

CPTD CLI is a free and open-source project.
Its full source code is available in the public repository:  
https://github.com/asbjornrasen/cptd-dsl

This guarantees full transparency, increases trust and security, and allows anyone to inspect, contribute to, or fork the system.
By being open, CPTD ensures long-term independence and verifiability.

Ready? Submit Your Command to the Official CPTD CLI Repository:

- Fork the repository:  
    [https://github.com/asbjornrasen/cptdcli-plugin](https://github.com/asbjornrasen/cptdcli-plugin)
    
- Create a branch:  
    feature/mycommand
    
- Add your ZIP archive to:  
    cptdcli-plugin/community_plugin/yourcommand.zip
    
- Ensure that:
    
    - the structure is correct
        
    - `main.py`, manifests, and folders are in the root of the archive
        
    - `--help` works
        
    - no auto-install logic is used
        
- Append your plugin manifest at the end of the `community-plugins.json` file with the following format:
    

{  
"name": "example",  
"description": "example",  
"version": "1.0.0",  
"target": "Windows",  
"entrypoint": "example.py",  
"dependencies": ["example"],  
"author": "example",  
"email": "example@example.com",  
"github": "https://github.com/example/example",  
"website": "https://example.com",  
"license": "example.md"  
}

When specifying "target", define the target OS: Windows, Linux, MacOS, or All.

How to Add a New Command to CPTD CLI
---

To add your command to the CLI, run:

cptd command --add yourcommand.zip

Submission Format (ZIP ONLY)

All CPTD CLI commands must be submitted as a `.zip` archive.

Example of a Simple Command:  

taskcleaner.zip  
├── main.py  
├── manifest.yaml  
└── manifest.json  

Example of a Project-Level Command with Subfolders:  

taskmanager.zip  
├── main.py  
├── manifest.yaml  
├── manifest.json  
├── util/  
│   └── parser.py  
└── service/  
└── api.py  

Rules:

* `main.py`, `manifest.yaml`, and `manifest.json` must be located at the root of the archive
* The archive must not contain a nested folder named after the command
* The archive name determines the command name:
  For example: `taskcleaner.zip` → `cptd taskcleaner`
* `manifest.yaml` and `manifest.json` must both explicitly define `entrypoint: main.py`
* If `main.py` is placed in a subfolder, the command will be rejected
* Both manifest files (YAML and JSON) are required
* Folders like `util/` and `service/` are allowed and encouraged for modular design
* Auto-installation of dependencies in code is strictly prohibited

Mandatory Elements of a Command

Each command must contain the following required elements:

1. `SYNTAX` — Command Description:  
  
SYNTAX = {  
"name": "yourcommand",  
"description": "What this command does.",  
"usage": "cptd yourcommand --input <path> \[--flag]",  
"arguments": \[  
{"name": "--input",  
"required": True,  
"help": "Path to input file"},  
{"name": "--flag",  
"required": False,  
"help": "Optional flag"}  
],  
"examples": \[  
"cptd yourcommand --input file.cptd",  
"cptd yourcommand --input folder --flag"  
]  
}  

2. `run(argv)` Function:  

def run(argv):
...

This is the entry point invoked when the command is executed.

3. `--help` Handling and Help Output:

if "--help" in argv or "-h" in argv:  
print\_help(SYNTAX)  
return  

This ensures unified help and autodocumentation support.

4. Use of `print_help(SYNTAX)` on Errors:  

except Exception as e:  
print(f"\[!] Argument error: {e}")  
print\_help(SYNTAX)  
return  

Recommended Template:  

from pathlib import Path  
import argparse  
from cptd\_tools.syntax\_utils import print\_help  

SYNTAX = {  
"name": "yourcommand",  
"description": "Describe what this command does.",  
"usage": "cptd yourcommand --input <path> \[--flag]",  
"arguments": \[
{"name": "--input", "required": True, "help": "Path to the input file or folder"},  
{"name": "--flag", "required": False, "help": "Optional flag to control behavior"}  
],  
"examples": \[  
"cptd yourcommand --input file.cptd",  
"cptd yourcommand --input folder --flag"  
]  
}  

def run(argv):  
if "--help" in argv or "-h" in argv:  
print\_help(SYNTAX)  
return  

---
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=SYNTAX["description"], add_help=False)  
parser.add_argument('--input', type=Path, required=True, help='Path to the input file or folder')  
parser.add_argument('--flag', action='store_true', help='Optional flag')  

try:  
    args = parser.parse_args(argv)  
except Exception as e:  
    print(f"[!] Argument error: {e}")  
    print_help(SYNTAX)  
    return  

if not args.input.exists():  
    print(f"[!] Input path does not exist:\n    {args.input}")  
    return  

print(f"[✔] Processing input: {args.input}")  
if args.flag:  
    print("[✔] Flag is set.")

---

What to add to every command:
---

At the very beginning of your `yourcommand.py` file, before any other imports, add:


from cptd_tools.os_guard import ensure_compatible
ensure_compatible(__file__)


What this call does:

* It reads the `manifest.yaml` or `manifest.json` file located next to the command file.
* It checks the `target` field.
* If the current operating system does not match the `target` value:

  * It prints a message,  
  * Deletes the command folder,  
  * Exits the execution using `sys.exit(1)`.  

Example beginning of a command:    


from cptd_tools.os_guard import ensure_compatible
ensure_compatible(__file__)  # ← this line is mandatory

from colorama import Fore  
from cptd_tools.syntax_utils import print_help  


Why this is important:

Even though `command --add` already filters commands by operating system, calling `ensure_compatible(__file__)`:

* Guarantees protection on every run, even if the command was manually added to the CLI.
* Automatically removes the command at runtime if the system is not compatible.
* Makes each command self-contained and secure.


---

Testing or Add Your Command:
---

To add your command to the CLI, run:

cptd command --add yourcommand.zip

To list all available commands:

cptd list

To view help for your command:

cptd yourcommand --help

To run your command:

cptd yourcommand

To delete your command:

cptd command --del yourcommand

---

Standards:

* `SYNTAX` is required
* `run(argv)` is required
* `--help` must not use `argparse`; use `print_help(SYNTAX)` only
* Code must be clean, readable, and free from unnecessary dependencies

Required Manifest Files:

Both manifest files must be in the same folder as `main.py`.

* `manifest.yaml` — human-readable
* `manifest.json` — machine-readable

Required fields in both manifests:  

name: Unique name of the command (must match the archive name)  
description: What the command does  
version: Version (example: 1.0.0)  
entrypoint: Always set to main.py  
target: Supported OS (example: all, linux, windows, macos)  
dependencies: Required pip libraries  
author: Author’s name  
email: Contact email  
github: GitHub link  
website: Website (optional)  
license: License (example: MIT, license.md, etc.)
