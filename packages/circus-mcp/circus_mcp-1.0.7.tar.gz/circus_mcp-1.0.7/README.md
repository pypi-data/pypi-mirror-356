A simple and powerful process management tool that combines Circus process manager with AI agent integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is Circus MCP?

In today's complex microservices development landscape, Circus MCP enables AI coding agents to work more efficiently, contributing to society through better development productivity.

Circus MCP provides direct process control through the Model Context Protocol, eliminating the overhead of shell commands and reducing token consumption for AI agents managing development environments.

**Core Features**:
- **AI Integration**: Built-in MCP protocol support for coding agents
- **Simple Commands**: Easy-to-use CLI for developers
- **Smart Operations**: Idempotent commands that work reliably
- **Microservices Ready**: Manage multiple services effortlessly

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
uv add circus-mcp
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the daemon
uv run circus-mcp start-daemon

# Add and start a web application
uv run circus-mcp add webapp "python app.py"
uv run circus-mcp start webapp

# Check what's running
uv run circus-mcp overview

# View logs
uv run circus-mcp logs webapp
```

That's it! Your process is now managed by Circus MCP.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Process Management Made Easy

```bash
# Add processes with options
uv run circus-mcp add api "uvicorn app:api" --numprocesses 4 --working-dir /app

# Smart operations (won't fail if already running)
uv run circus-mcp ensure-started api

# Bulk operations
uv run circus-mcp start-all
uv run circus-mcp restart-all
```

### 📊 Comprehensive Monitoring

```bash
# Beautiful overview of all services
uv run circus-mcp overview

# Detailed status information
uv run circus-mcp status-all

# Real-time log viewing
uv run circus-mcp tail api
uv run circus-mcp logs-all
```

### 🤖 AI Agent Integration

Circus MCP includes built-in MCP protocol support, allowing AI agents to manage your processes:

```bash
# Start MCP server for AI integration
uv run circus-mcp mcp
```

Configure in your AI agent using the **recommended stdio transport**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "circus-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "circus-mcp", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: This tool is designed for local development environments using MCP's stdio transport method as specified in the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This approach provides secure, direct communication between AI agents and the process manager.

## Common Use Cases

### Web Application Management

```bash
# Production web app with multiple workers
uv run circus-mcp add webapp "gunicorn app:application" --numprocesses 4
uv run circus-mcp add worker "celery worker -A app" --numprocesses 2
uv run circus-mcp ensure-started all
```

### Development Environment

```bash
# Start your development stack
uv run circus-mcp add frontend "npm run dev" --working-dir /app/frontend
uv run circus-mcp add backend "python manage.py runserver" --working-dir /app/backend
uv run circus-mcp add redis "redis-server"
uv run circus-mcp start-all
```

### Microservices

```bash
# Manage multiple services
uv run circus-mcp add auth-service "python auth_service.py"
uv run circus-mcp add user-service "python user_service.py"
uv run circus-mcp add notification-service "python notification_service.py"
uv run circus-mcp ensure-started all
```

## Why Circus MCP?

### vs. Docker Compose
- **Lighter**: No containers needed, just process management
- **Faster**: Direct process execution, no container overhead
- **Simpler**: One command to rule them all

### vs. systemd
- **User-friendly**: Simple commands instead of unit files
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any system with Python
- **AI-ready**: Built-in MCP support for automation

### vs. PM2
- **Python-native**: Perfect for Python applications
- **AI integration**: MCP protocol support out of the box
- **Comprehensive**: Process + log management in one tool

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent State Management

```bash
# These commands are safe to run multiple times
uv run circus-mcp ensure-started webapp    # Only starts if not running
uv run circus-mcp ensure-stopped worker    # Only stops if running
```

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Work with all processes at once
uv run circus-mcp start-all     # Start everything
uv run circus-mcp stop-all      # Stop everything
uv run circus-mcp restart-all   # Restart everything
uv run circus-mcp logs-all      # See all logs
```

### Log Management

```bash
# View logs with filtering
uv run circus-mcp logs webapp --lines 100 --stream stderr
uv run circus-mcp tail webapp --stream stdout

# See recent activity across all services
uv run circus-mcp logs-all
```
