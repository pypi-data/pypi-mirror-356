This package provides classes `Sigmoid` and `HillCurve` for fitting, plotting and
interpolating EMG recruitment curves. These might be suitable for the M-wave and H-reflex
components, respectively, of the EMG responses to electrical peripheral nerve stimulation.
Feed in a sequence of stimulation intensities and corresponding sequence of response
magnitudes. These can be used from the command-line, outside of python.

The package also provides a higher-level class `RecruitmentCurve` which takes in EMG
waveforms, together with information on the start and end times of the response components
of interest, and performs either or both of the above fits, optionally rendering the results
on an interactive plot.

To get started::

    python -m pip install RecruitmentCurveFitting
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting --unpack-examples
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting example-data1.txt example-data2.txt --plot
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting --help
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting --help-module
