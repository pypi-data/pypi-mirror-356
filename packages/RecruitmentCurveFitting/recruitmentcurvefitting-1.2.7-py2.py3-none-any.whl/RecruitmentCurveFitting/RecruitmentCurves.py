"""
Python classes, and a command-line utility, for fitting sigmoid and
bell-shaped curves derived from EMG data.

Third-party requirements:

- `numpy`
- `scipy.optimize` (via the generic `CurveFitting` module)
- `matplotlib` if you want to plot

Example of use as a Python module::

    from RecruitmentCurveFitting import Sigmoid, HillCurve

    x = [1.50, 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.50, 2.50, 3.00, 3.00, 3.50, 3.50, 4.00, 4.00, 4.50, 4.50, 5.00]
    m = [0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.03, 0.19, 0.13, 0.98, 1.11, 2.13, 2.17, 2.39, 2.39, 2.42, 2.45, 2.45]
    h = [0.12, 0.11, 0.99, 1.14, 1.53, 1.93, 1.15, 1.05, 0.17, 0.28, 0.14, 0.12, 0.12, 0.14, 0.13]

    mFit = Sigmoid( x, m )
    hFit = HillCurve( x, h )

    hMaxStim, hMax = hFit.Find( 'max' )
    mMax = mFit.uHeight.finalValue
    mThresholdStim = mFit.Backward( 0.1, scaled=False )

    mFit.Plot( markX=mThresholdStim, markY=mMax )
    hFit.Plot( markX=hMaxStim, markY=hMax, hold=True)
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.show()  # if necessary

This module also contains a higher-level class, `RecruitmentCurve`, which
you construct using an array of EMG time-series, and use to extract both
`m` and `h` magnitudes and fit them, given their start and end points in
milliseconds::
    
    from RecruitmentCurveFitting import RecruitmentCurve, UnpackExamples

    UnpackExamples() # writes assorted example files to the current directory

    z = RecruitmentCurve('example-waveforms.csv') # that's one of the files
    z.Fit( boundsM=[8.1, 15.9], boundsH=[34.6, 42.4] )
    z.Plot() # try hovering the mouse pointer over each data-point, it's fun
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.show()  # if necessary
	
This module can also be run as a standalone command-line utility. Input files
should be formatted as comma- or space-delimited numeric tables where the last
three columns are stimulation intensity, M-wave size and H-reflex size. Prior
columns, if present, are used to separate different conditions from each other
(each condition generates one pair of curve fits, and one figure if requested)
Column headings are optional. For example::

    # If you didn't already unpack the example files in the current directory,
    # then first do this:
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting --unpack-examples
    
    # Then the demo is:
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting example-data1.txt example-data2.txt -p -s out.pdf
    
    # Run this for further details:
    python -m RecruitmentCurveFitting --help

		        one stimulation-intensity value per column of `waveforms`.
