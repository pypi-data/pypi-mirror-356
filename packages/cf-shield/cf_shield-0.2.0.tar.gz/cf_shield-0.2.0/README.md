# CF-Shield

CF-Shield is a Python package for detecting DDoS attacks and enabling security measures on Cloudflare automatically.

## Installation

Install CF-Shield using pip:

```bash
pip install cf-shield
```

First, you will need to get your Cloudflare email, API token, zone ID, and account ID.

After installation, run:

```bash
cf-shield
```

When running the script for the first time, it will ask you for your Cloudflare email, API token, zone ID, and account ID. More info on [Setup](#setup).

## Setup
To setup the script, you will need to run the script and follow the prompts. Here you have a list of what the script will ask you for and what you need to do. The prompts with `default:` are optional and will be set to the default value if you don't enter anything.

The full setup looks like this:

```
  /$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$$       /$$$$$$  /$$       /$$           /$$       /$$

### 1. Domains
`What's the domain(s) you want to use? (e.g. "example.com,www.example.com" or "example.com" or "all")`

This is the domain(s) you want to use. You can add multiple domains by separating them with a comma. The domains must be on the same [Zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones) (meaning a single WAF rule can be applied to all of them).

If you want to use all domains in the zone, you can enter `all`.

If you change this after the inital setup, you will need to remove the rule from the dashboard and run the script again.

### 2. Email
`What's the email you used to sign up for Cloudflare? (e.g. example@example.com)`

This must be the email you used to sign up for Cloudflare. You can find it [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile).

### 3. API Token
`Please create an API token and copy it here (e.g. aK-MaF3oyTrPDD8YoNBlvqo0ous7BOeSA7te84OR)`

This is the API token you need to create. You can create it [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). There is a guide [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/). You need to create a token with `Zone WAF Write` permissions. It should be 40 characters long and only contain letters, numbers and dashes.

### 4. Zone ID
`Please copy the zone ID from the URL of your Cloudflare dashboard (e.g. 1b7c0e3d41f09ceb9cbcde6b0c7bc819)`

This is the zone ID you need to copy from the URL of your Cloudflare dashboard. You can find it [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/#copy-your-zone-id). It should be 32 characters long and only contain letters and numbers.

### 5. Account ID
`Please copy the account ID from the URL of your Cloudflare dashboard (e.g. 6dead821d9eb4c42f8a8dda399651660)`

The account ID can be found below the zone ID. It should not be the same as the zone ID. If you can't find it, there is more info [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/#copy-your-account-id). It should be 32 characters long and only contain letters and numbers.

#### This was the last prompt you could not set blank. After setting this you can leave blank the other prompts.

### 6. CPU Threshold
`Please enter the CPU usage threshold in percentage (default: 80)`

This is the CPU usage threshold you want to use. The script will enable the challenge rule if the CPU usage is greater than this threshold. It should be a number between 0 and 100. It is advised to set it to a value between 50 and 90 depending on your server's performance and average load.

### 7. Challenge Type
`What's the challenge type you want to use? (default: managed_challenge, options: managed_challenge, js_challenge, challenge)`

This is the challenge type you want to use. You can choose between `managed_challenge`, `js_challenge` and `challenge`.

`js_challenge` is a challenge that uses JavaScript to detect bots. It is the fastest challenge type to load, but it is also not as effective as `challenge` or `managed_challenge`.

`challenge` is a challenge that uses a CAPTCHA to detect bots, it was the first challenge type to be released by Cloudflare. It is the most effective challenge type, but it is also the most resource intensive and slowest to load.

`managed_challenge` is the default challenge type. Cloudflare will choose to use `js_challenge` or `challenge` based on how likely it thinks the request is a bot.

Usually it is best to start with `managed_challenge` and then switch to `challenge` if the bots are still able to bypass the challenge.

If you change this after the inital setup, you will need to remove the rule from the dashboard and run the script again.

### 8. Discord Webhook (optional)
`If you want to use a Discord webhook, please enter the webhook URL (default: None)`

This is the Discord webhook URL you want to use. You can find a guide [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). It should be a valid Discord webhook URL. You will get messages when the challenge is enabled or disabled.

If you don't want to use a Discord webhook, you can leave it blank.

### 9. Telegram Bot Token (optional)
`If you want to use a Telegram bot, please enter the bot token (default: None)`

This is the Telegram bot token you want to use. You can find a guide [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token). It should be a valid Telegram bot token. You will get messages when the challenge is enabled or disabled. If you set a bot token, you will also need to set a chat ID.

If you don't want to get Telegram notifications, you can leave it blank.

### 9.1. Telegram Chat ID (optional, only if you set a Telegram bot token)
`Please enter the chat ID for the telegram bot (default: None)`

This is the chat ID you want to use. You can find a guide [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-chat-id). It should be a valid Telegram chat ID. You will get messages when the challenge is enabled or disabled. If you set a bot token, you will also need to set a chat ID.

If you haven't set a bot token, you will not see this prompt.

### 10. Challenge Rule Disable Delay
`How many seconds do you want to wait before disabling the challenge rule? (default: 30)`

This is the delay in seconds you want to use before disabling the challenge rule. This is to avoid the rule to be disabled and enabled fast when the CPU lowers because of the challenge. It should be a number between 0 and infinity. But it is advised to set it to a value between 5 and 1800.


## Usage

After installation, run:

```bash
cf-shield
```

Or if you want to use it as a Python module:

```python
from cf_shield import run
run()
```

To modify the config, you can edit the .env file.
