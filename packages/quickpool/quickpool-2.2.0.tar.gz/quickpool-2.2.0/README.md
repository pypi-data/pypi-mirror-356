# quickpool

Use ProcessPoolExecutor and ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures with a progress bar and less boilerplate.

## Installation

Install with:

```console
pip install quickpool
```

## Usage

```python
>>> import random
>>> import time
>>> import quickpool
>>> def naptime(base_duration: float, multiplier: float, return_val: int)->int:
...   time.sleep(base_duration * multiplier)
...   return return_val
...
>>> def demo():
...   iterations = 25
...   pool = quickpool.ThreadPool(
...   functions = [naptime] * iterations,
...   args_list = [(random.random() * 5, random.random()) for _ in range(iterations)],
...   kwargs_list = [{"return_val": i} for i in range(iterations)])
...   results = pool.execute()
...   print(results)
...
>>> demo()
