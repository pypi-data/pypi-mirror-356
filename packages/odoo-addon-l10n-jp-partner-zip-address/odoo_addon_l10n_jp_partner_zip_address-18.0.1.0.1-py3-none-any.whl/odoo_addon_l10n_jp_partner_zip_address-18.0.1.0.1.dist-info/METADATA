This module introduces a function that automatically retrieves and fills
in the Japanese address details for a partner using the zipcloud
service, provided that the following conditions are met.

- Country is Japan or no country is set for the partner.
- A valid postcode is entered for the partner.

Note that in order to have the prefecture proposed automatically, you
need to have the prefecture records in Japanese (e.g. "福岡県" instead
of "Fukuoka"). This can be done by overriding the name of correspoinding
res.country.state records, or by installing the l10n_jp_country_state
module.
