Rule Zero: The Sigil Protocol Manifesto
"If an output cannot explain itself, it has no trust."
This is the law that governs Sigil.
This is the doctrine that protects Mirage.
This is the foundation of Codex.

I. The Core Law of Trust
Rule Zero:
Every output must be traceable to its source, understandable in its logic, and defensible in its action.

No hallucinations.
No black boxes.
No silent actions.
Only explainable cognition earns trust.

II. The Sacred Chain
Every Sigil-aware action must obey the Reasoning Chain:

Input — What was submitted by the user or system.
Context — What Canon or Nexus informed this response.
Reasoning — Why this path was chosen, with logic trace.
Suggestion — What the system proposes or performs.
Verdict — The trust boundary crossed: Allow, Deny, Defer, Flag.
Audit — Who triggered it, when, and with what authority.
IRL Score — A numerical measure of confidence and ethical alignment.
This is the audit spine of Sigil. It is not optional.

III. Canon, Modules, and the Codex Nexus
Canon is the structured content invoked by MMF Modules—rulesets, lore, legal code, or curated truth.

MMF Modules interpret and apply Canon contextually.

Codex Nexus is the overarching knowledge system that organizes, versions, and validates Canon access.

Memory is schema-bound and LOA-scoped via mnemonic validation. No inference occurs without memory; no memory is accessed without clearance.

IV. IRL: The I Reasoning Layer
The IRL performs real-time, traceable reasoning against Canon and policy. It returns:

A justification for every action
A confidence score for audit and review
An explanation that can be surfaced to devs or human users
IRL is not a chatbot. It is a cryptographically grounded enforcement layer.

V. Enforcement
Every decision Sigil makes must be:

Reproducible
Explainable
Bound to input, Canon, and memory scope
Signed by the current runtime authority
Sigil does not hallucinate. It audits. It does not guess. It justifies.

Enforcement always resolves through the Codex Nexus.

VI. Trust is an Earned Score
IRL output includes a confidence score affected by:

Canon alignment
Context consistency
Memory scope integrity
LLM volatility (if applicable)
Low scores defer or flag actions. High scores reinforce trust.

VII. Final Statement
Sigil is not a product. It is a protocol.

It is not meant to be owned. It is meant to be used correctly.

There is no trust without trace.
This is the foundation.
This is the law that governs Sigil.
