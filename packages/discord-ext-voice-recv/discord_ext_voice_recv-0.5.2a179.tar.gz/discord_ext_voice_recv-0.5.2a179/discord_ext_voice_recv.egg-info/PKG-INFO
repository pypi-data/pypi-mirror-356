# discord-ext-voice-recv
Voice receive extension package for discord.py

## Warning
**This extension should be more or less functional, but the code is not yet feature complete.  No guarantees are given for stability or random breaking changes.**

See the [update notes](update_notes.md) for a poor excuse for a changelog.

## Installing
**Python 3.8 or higher is required**, preferably at least 3.11 or whatever is latest

```
python -m pip install discord-ext-voice-recv
```

To install directly from github:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/imayhaveborkedit/discord-ext-voice-recv
```

Naturally, this extension depends on `discord.py` being installed with voice support (`pynacl`).

## Example
See the [example script](examples/recv.py).

## Feature overview
### Custom VoiceProtocol client
No monkey patching or bizarre hacks required.  Simply use the library feature to use `VoiceRecvClient` as the voice client class.  See [Usage](#usage).

### New events
This extension adds the unimplemented voice websocket events and three virtual events.  See [New Events](#new-events).

### Speaking state
It is now possible to determine if a member is speaking or not, using `VoiceRecvClient.get_speaking()`, or using the speaking events inside an `AudioSink`.

### Simple and familiar API
The overall API is designed to mirror the discord.py voice send API, with `AudioSink` being the counterpart to the existing `AudioSource`.  See [Sinks](#sinks).

### Convenient included utilities
Batteries included in the form of useful built in `AudioSinks`.  Some to match their `AudioSource` counterpart, some I merely considered useful.  See... uh... TODO.

### Optional extras
Slightly more complex included batteries that depend on external packages.  These live in `voice_recv.extras`.  They can be installed by adding their optional dependency during install, ex: `pip install discord-ext-voice-recv[extras_thing]`, or all of them can be installed by specifying `extras` instead.  See [Extras](#extras).

### More or less typed
It's probably fine.

## Usage
### VoiceRecvClient
The class `voice_recv.VoiceRecvClient` must be used in `VoiceChannel.connect()` to enable voice receive functionality.
```python
from discord.ext import voice_recv

voice_client = await voice_channel.connect(cls=voice_recv.VoiceRecvClient)
```

### New voice client functions
```python
def listen(sink: voice_recv.AudioSink, *, after=None) -> None
```
Receives audio data into an `AudioSink`.  A sink is similar to the `AudioSource` class, where most of the logic is done in a single callback function, but in reverse.  Sinks are explained in detail in the [Sinks](#sinks) section below.

The finalizer, `after` is called after the sink has been exhausted or an error occurred.  The callback signature is the same as the after callback for `play()`, one parameter for an optional Exception object.

```python
def is_listening() -> bool
```
Returns `True` if the voice client is currently receiving audio.  Specifically, if the bot is reading from the voice socket.

```python
def stop() -> None
```
This function now stops both receiving and sending of audio.

```python
def stop_listening() -> None
```
Stops receiving audio.

```python
def stop_playing() -> None
```
Stops playing audio.  This function is identical to `discord.VoiceClient.stop()`.

```python
def get_speaking(member: discord.Member | discord.User) -> bool | None
```
Gets the speaking state (voice activity, the green circle) of a member.  User is typed in for convenience.  Returns None if the member was not found.

## Sinks
The API of this extension is designed to mirror the discord.py voice send API.  Sending audio uses the `AudioSource` class, while receiving audio uses the `AudioSink` class.  A sink is designed to be the inverse of a source.  Essentially, a source is a callback called by discord.py to produce a chunk of audio data.  Conversely, a sink is a callback called by the library to handle a chunk of audio.  Sinks can be composed in the same fashion as sources, creating an audio processing pipeline.  Sources and sinks can even combined into one object to handle both tasks, such as creating a feedback loop.

Special care should be taken not to write excessively computationally expensive code, as python is not particularly well suited to real-time audio processing.

Due to voice receive being somewhat more complex than voice sending, sinks have additional functionality compared to sources.  However, the core sink functions should look relatively familiar.

```python
class MySink(voice_recv.AudioSink):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def wants_opus(self) -> bool:
        return False

    def write(self, user: User | Member | None, data: VoiceData):
        ...

    def cleanup(self):
        ...
```

These are the main functions of a sink, names and purpose reflecting that of their source counterparts.  It is important to note that `super().__init__()` must be called when inheriting from `AudioSink`, in contrast to `AudioSource` which does not have a default `__init__` function.

- The `wants_opus()` function determines if the sink should receive opus packets or decoded PCM packets.  Care should be taken not to unintentionally mix sinks that want different types.
- The `write()` function is the main callback, where the sink logic takes place.  In a sink pipeline, this could alter, inspect, or log a packet, and then write it to a child sink.  `VoiceData` is a simple container class with attributes for the origin member, opus data, optionally pcm data, and raw audio packet.
- The `cleanup()` function is identical to `AudioSource.cleanup()`, a finalizer to cleanup any loose ends when the sink has finished its job.

Additionally, sinks also have properties for their `client` and `voice_client`, as well as `parent` and `child`/`children` sinks.

### Built in Sinks
This extension comes with several useful built in sinks, as well as a few [extras](#extras) mentioned later.  For a more information, you will have to [source dive](discord/ext/voice_recv/sinks.py) for now.

- `AudioSink` - The base class for most sinks, similar in purpose to the discord.py `AudioSource`.
  - `MultiAudioSink` - A sink that supports writing to multiple destination sinks.  Has no subclass implementations currently.  Generally intended to be extended by the user.
  - `BasicSink` - A simple sink that operates based on a user provided callback.  Useful for testing or simple tasks not performed by other sinks.
  - `WaveSink` - Writes audio data to a .wav file.  It does not fill in silence or mix audio from multiple users on its own.  `WavSink` is an alias for this sink.
  - `FFmpegSink` - Uses ffmpeg to convert the audio stream to an arbitrary format, or whatever else ffmpeg can do to it.  Requires ffmpeg, but you should already have it working for discord.py.
  - `PCMVolumeTransformer` - The AudioSink analog to the discord.py AudioSource version.  Does exactly the same thing: controls the volume.
  - `ConditionalFilter` - Filters audio data based on a given predicate.  If the predicate fails for a packet, it is not written to the destination sink.
    - `UserFilter` - A conditional filter to check if data is from a given user.
    - `TimedFilter` - A conditional filter with a timer for how long it should operate.
  - `SilenceGeneratorSink` - Generates silence to fill in audio transmission downtime for a continuous data stream.  **Note: This sink is pretty broken and buggy right now and slated for rewrite.  Usage is not advised.**

### Sink event listeners
With AudioSinks being potentially more complex and stateful than AudioSources and the addition of new events, it is sometimes necessary to handle events in the context of a sink.  It would be rather awkward to have to register a sink function with `commands.Bot.add_listener()` while dealing with thread safety, and even more so using `discord.Client`.  To remedy this, listeners can be defined within sinks, similarly to how they work in Cogs.

```python
class MySink(AudioSink):
    @AudioSink.listener()
    def on_voice_member_disconnect(self, member: discord.Member, ssrc: int | None):
        print(f"{member} has disconnected")
        self.do_something_like_handle_disconnect(ssrc)
```

Note that these functions must be sync functions, as they are dispatched from a thread.  Trying to use an async function will result in an error.  This restriction only applies to sink listeners, and normal async event listeners will function as per usual.  The event listener dispatch thread is different from the one used to dispatch the `write()` callback so potential thread safety issues should be considered.  A decorator argument to run the event callback in the other thread *may* be added later.

## New events
```python
async def on_voice_member_speaking_state(member: discord.Member, ssrc: int, state: SpeakingState | int)
```
First and foremost, this event does **NOT** refer to the speaking indicator in discord (the green circle).  For voice activity, see `on_voice_member_speaking_start`.
This event is fired when the speaking state (speaking mode) of a member changes.  This happens when:
- A member first speaks (transmits audio) in a voice, but only once per session
- A member activates or deactivates priority speaker mode

This event is fired once initially to reveal the ssrc of a member, an identifier to map packets to their originating member.  Any packets received from this member before this event fires can (probably) be safely ignored since they are likely just silence packets.

```python
async def on_voice_member_connect(member: discord.Member)
```

Called when a member connects to a voice channel. Also called on initial connection for every member in the channel.

```python
async def on_voice_member_disconnect(member: discord.Member, ssrc: int | None)
```
Called when a member disconnects from a voice channel. The `ssrc` parameter is the unique id a member has to identify which packets belong to them.  This is useful when using custom sinks, particularly those that handle packets from multiple members.

```python
async def on_voice_member_video(member: discord.Member, data: voice_recv.VoiceVideoStreams)
```
Called when a member in voice channel toggles their webcam on or off, NOT screenshare.  Screenshare status is only indicated in the `self_video` attribute of `discord.VoiceState`.

```python
async def on_voice_member_flags(member: discord.Member, flags: voice_recv.VoiceFlags)
```
An undocumented event dispatched when a member joins a voice channel containing a flags bitfield. Also called on initial connection for every member in the channel.

Flags:
- `VoiceFlags.clips_enabled`: User has [clips](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/16861982215703-Clips) enabled
- `VoiceFlags.allow_voice_recording`: User has consented to their voice being clipped
- `VoiceFlags.allow_any_viewer_clips`: User has consented to stream viewers clipping them

```python
async def on_voice_member_platform(member: discord.Member, platform: voice_recv.VoicePlatform | None)
```
An undocumented event dispatched when a member joins a voice channel containing the member's platform. Also called on initial connection for every member in the channel.

Values:
- `VoicePlatform.desktop`
- `VoicePlatform.mobile`
- `VoicePlatform.xbox`
- `VoicePlatform.playstation`

```python
def on_rtcp_packet(packet: RTCPPacket, guild: discord.Guild)
```
A virtual event for when an RTCP packet is received.  This event only works inside of sinks, so it cannot be async.

```python
def on_voice_member_speaking_start(member: discord.Member)
def on_voice_member_speaking_stop(member: discord.Member)
```
Virtual events for the state of the speaking indicator (the green circle).  These events are synthesized from packet activity and may not exactly match what is displayed in the discord client.  Due to performance issues with asyncio, this event is sink only and cannot be async.

## Extras

### `voice_recv.extras.speechrecognition`
- Optional dependency: `extras_speech`
- Requires package: `SpeechRecognition`
- Provides: `SpeechRecognitionSink`

A helper sink for using `SpeechRecognition` to perform speech-to-text conversion.  Generally depends on third party services for reasonable quality.  Results may vary.

### `voice_recv.extras.localplayback`
- Optional dependency: `extras_local`
- Requires package: `pyaudio`
- Provides: `LocalPlaybackSink`, `SimpleLocalPlaybackSink`

Helper sinks for playing audio through an audio output device the local system.  Defaults to the system default device, but other output devices can also be specified.

## Currently missing or WIP features
- Silence generation (WIP, pending rewrite)

## Future plans
- Muxer AudioSink (mixes multiple audio streams into a single stream)
- Rust implementations of some components for improved performance
- Alternative voice client implementation with a minimal interface intended for use with external data processing
