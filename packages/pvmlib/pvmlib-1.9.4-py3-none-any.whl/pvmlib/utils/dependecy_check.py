class DependencyChecker:
    """
    A class for checking the status of various dependencies required by the application.

    This class allows you to define a list of functions, each responsible for checking
    a specific dependency (e.g., database connection, external service availability).
    It then provides a method to execute these checks and return a dictionary of results.

        Initializes the DependencyChecker with a list of dependency check functions.

        Args:
            dependencies (List[Callable[[], Dict[str, str]]]): A list of functions, where each function
                takes no arguments and returns a dictionary with a single key-value pair.
                The key represents the dependency name (e.g., "mongodb", "external_api")
                and the value is a string indicating its status ("UP" or "DOWN").

        each one, and aggregates the results into a single dictionary.  If any check
        raises an exception, it raises an HTTPException with a 500 status code.
