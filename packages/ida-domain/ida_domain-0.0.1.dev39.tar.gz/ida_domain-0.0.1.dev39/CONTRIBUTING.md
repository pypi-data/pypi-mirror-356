pytest tests/
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below.

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Run existing tests
   uv run pytest
   
   # Test CLI commands manually
   uv run hcli whoami
   uv run hcli plugin list

   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork and create a Pull Request**.

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Architecture Patterns

- **Commands**: Use `@async_command` decorator for async operations
- **Authentication**: Add `@require_auth` decorator for protected endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Use Rich console for user-friendly error messages
- **API Clients**: Extend patterns in `/src/hcli/lib/api/`
- **Configuration**: Add new environment variables to the `ENV` class

### Code Organization

- Keep related functionality in the same module
- Use the existing command structure for new commands
- Follow the established patterns for API integration
- Add appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Include examples in docstrings where helpful
- Keep inline comments concise and meaningful

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for CLI commands where appropriate

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
2. **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
4. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation if needed

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] New functionality is tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

## Development Tips

### Running Specific Commands

```bash
# Test authentication
uv run hcli whoami

# Test plugin operations
uv run hcli plugin list

# Test with debug output
HCLI_DEBUG=true uv run hcli plugin search python
```

### Environment Variables

Set these for development:

- `HCLI_DEBUG=true`: Enable debug output
- `HCLI_API_URL`: Override API endpoint for testing
- `HCLI_API_KEY`: Use API key authentication

### Common Issues

- **Authentication errors**: Make sure you're logged in with `hcli login`
- **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
- **Path issues**: Use absolute paths in tests and be mindful of cross-platform compatibility
