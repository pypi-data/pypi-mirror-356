    "description": "3DXRD is a far field diffraction technique capable of reconstructing polycrystalline materials from the individual diffraction spots recorded in the diffraction pattern given that the crystallographic parameters of the material are known. The success of the technique is based on the ability of the individual diffraction spots to be separated. This means there is a trade off between the number of grains and the degree of strain that is measurable."
