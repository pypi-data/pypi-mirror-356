### ðŸŽ‰ Major Project Rebrand: VoiceMCP â†’ VoiceMode

We're excited to announce that **voice-mcp** has been rebranded to **VoiceMode**! 

This change reflects our vision for the project's future. While MCP (Model Context Protocol) describes the underlying technology, VoiceMode better captures what this tool actually delivers - a seamless voice interaction mode for AI assistants.

#### Why the Change?
- **Clarity**: VoiceMode immediately communicates the tool's purpose
- **Timelessness**: The name isn't tied to a specific protocol that may evolve
- **Simplicity**: Easier to remember and more intuitive for users

#### What's Changed?
- Primary command renamed from `voice-mcp` to `voicemode`
- GitHub repository moved to `mbailey/voicemode`
- Primary PyPI package is now `voice-mode` (hyphenated due to naming restrictions)
- Legacy `voice-mcp` package maintained for backward compatibility
- Documentation and branding updated throughout
- Simplified package structure to dual-package configuration

#### Backward Compatibility
- The `voice-mcp` command remains available for existing users
- Both `voice-mode` and `voice-mcp` packages available on PyPI
- All packages provide the `voicemode` command

### Changed
- Consolidated package configuration to two pyproject.toml files
- Made `voice-mode` the primary package with VoiceMode branding

- Local development documentation for uvx usage
