# Imantodes

**Imantodes** ("i-MAN-toe-dees"): light-weight Python code for creating new interactive scientific visualization programs. Taxonomically, [Imantodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imantodes) is a genus of slender (i.e. _light-weight_) snakes (like _pythons_, though a different taxonomic family) with very large eyes that help them see well at night (like how _visualization_ tools help show things otherwise hidden).

Imantodes is being created at the University of Chicago, mainly in summer 2025, but also in fits and starts in prior years. The main author of the currently included code is [Gordon Kindlmann](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/). Code written by students will be added soon.

The code has not yet stabilized enough for a versioned release.
