    Calculate price channel with upper and lower bounds.
    
    The channel is calculated by finding the highest high and lowest low over the lookback period.
    The width of the channel is adjusted to be bounds% of the midpoint.
    
    Args:
        - `high` (torch.Tensor): High prices tensor of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_assets)
        - `low` (torch.Tensor): Low prices tensor of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_assets). If None, uses close prices from high tensor
        - `lookback` (int): Period for calculating channel bounds
        - `bounds` (float): Width of the channel as percentage (0.0-1.0) from midpoint
            e.g. 0.8 means Â±40% from midpoint
