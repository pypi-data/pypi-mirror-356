**Hybrid Dependency Hypergraphs for Quantum Computation**

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
This library translates quantum computations into Hybrid Dependency Hypergraph (HDH) representations for analysis, visualization, and partitioning.

## Project Goals

- Convert quantum circuits into HDH format  
  - Support for popular SDKs (e.g., Qiskit)  
  - Direct encoding from algorithmic structures
- Print HDHs in a readable, canonical format  
- Apply graph partitioning (e.g., METIS, KaHyPar) for distribution-aware analysis
