<!--
Python implementation of the Discrete-Continuous Endogenous Grid Method (DC-EGM) for
solving dynamic stochastic lifecycle models of continuous (e.g. consumption-savings) and
additional discrete choices. -->

**Note:** This is a pre-release version of the package. While the core features are in
place, the interface and functionality may still evolve. Feedback and contributions are
welcome.

`dcegm` is a Python package for solving and simulating finite-horizon stochastic
discrete-continuous dynamic choice models using the DC-EGM algorithm from Iskhakov,
JÃ¸rgensen, Rust, and Schjerning (QE, 2017).

The solution algorithm employs an extension of the Fast Upper-Envelope Scan (FUES) from
Dobrescu & Shanker (2022).

## Installation

You can install `dcegm` via PyPI or directly from GitHub. In your terminal, run:

```console
$ pip install dcegm
```

To install the latest development version directly from the GitHub repository, run:

```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/dcegm.git
```
