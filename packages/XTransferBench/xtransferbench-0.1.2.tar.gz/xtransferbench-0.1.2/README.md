## X-TransferBench
**X-TransferBench** is an open-source benchmark that offers a comprehensive collection of Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) capable of achieving super adversarial transferability. These UAPs can simultaneously transfer **across data distributions, domains, model architectures**, and **downstream tasks**. In essence, they are perturbations that can convert virtually *any input sample* into an adversarial example—effective against *any model* and *any task*.

## Installation

Nightly Build (latest features from source)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hanxunh/XTransferBench.git
cd XTransferBench
pip3 install .
```

Stable Build (from PyPI)

```shell
pip3 install XTransferBench
```

---
## Usage
```python
import XTransferBench
import XTransferBench.zoo

# List threat models
print(XTransferBench.zoo.list_threat_model())

# List UAPs under L_inf threat model
print(XTransferBench.zoo.list_attacker('linf_non_targeted'))

# Load X-Transfer with the Large search space (N=64) non-targeted
attacker = XTransferBench.zoo.load_attacker('linf_non_targeted', 'xtransfer_large_linf_eps12_non_targeted')

# Perturbe images to adversarial example
images = # Tensor [b, 3, h, w]
adv_images = attacker(images) 
```

---
## Demo

We provide a web demo using X-TransferBench that allows you to transform any image into an adversarial example using our curated collection of UAPs and TUAPs. You can access the demo at the link below. Once generated, the adversarial example can be tested on any model and task of your choice.
