"""Package automatically populated by ndx_conelab.generator.

When ``ndx_conelab.generator.generate_extension`` is invoked, it places the
corresponding ``*.extensions.yaml`` file into this directory.  Optionally, a
future version might also generate hand-written Python subclasses here.  To
keep things simple the file is currently empty â€“ it only exists so that
``importlib`` can treat ``ndx_conelab.extensions`` as a regular package.
