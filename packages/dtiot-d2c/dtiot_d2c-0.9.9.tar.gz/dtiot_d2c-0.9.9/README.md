# Introduction
For the IoT platform **Device to Cloud** (**D2C**) from **Deutsche Telekom IoT GmbH** (**DTIOT**) we provide a command line interface ```d2c``` to support IoT system administrators and to help command line automation.  The command ```d2c``` comes with a wide range of sub-commands to access the **D2C** system via the **DMO** API (Device Management Orchestrator), also from **DTIOT**.
</br>
**d2c** has been implemented with **python3** and can be installed using **pip3** or **python3 -m pip** (see [getting started](https://myiot-d.com/docs/device-to-cloud/command-line-interface/getting-started/)).
</br>
</br>
> [!NOTE]
> **d2ccli** has been tested only on **MacOS** and **Linux** with **python 3.10** and **python 3.12**.
