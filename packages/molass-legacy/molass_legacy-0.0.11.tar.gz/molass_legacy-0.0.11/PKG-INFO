> [!NOTE]
> The molass_legacy package currently depends mutually on molass, which is the package name of
`Molass Library` referenced below. This mutual dependence is planned to be changed to one-way dependence from molass_legacy to molass.<br>The meaning of the planned change is as follows.<br>The molass package is a rewrite of molass_legacy and they have quite a lot in commmon, which will be rearranged and unified into the molass side.
