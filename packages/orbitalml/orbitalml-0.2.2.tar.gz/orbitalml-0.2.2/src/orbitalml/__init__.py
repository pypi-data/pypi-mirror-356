"""OrbitalML - Machine Learning pipeline to SQL converter

OrbitalML is a proxy package for the orbital library that provides the same
functionality with an alternative import name. It translates scikit-learn
pipelines into SQL queries and Ibis expressions.

This package allows you to execute machine learning models on databases without
the need for a Python runtime environment.

Usage:
    import orbitalml as orbital
    # Use exactly like the orbital package
