    Represents a classification system for sensitivity levels of data.

    Attributes:
        HIGHLY_SENSITIVE: Represents highly sensitive data, such as private or
            critical information.
        CONFIDENTIAL: Represents confidential data that requires restricted
            access.
        IDENTIFIABLE: Represents data that can directly identify individuals.
        POTENTIALLY_IDENTIFIABLE: Represents data that may not directly identify
            an individual but could do so when combined with other information.
        LIMITED: Operational or administrative data with minimal personal
            information but still requires protection.
        NON_SENSITIVE: Non-identifiable metadata or system information that
            poses minimal privacy risk
        UNKNOWN: Represents data with an unknown or undefined level of
            sensitivity.
