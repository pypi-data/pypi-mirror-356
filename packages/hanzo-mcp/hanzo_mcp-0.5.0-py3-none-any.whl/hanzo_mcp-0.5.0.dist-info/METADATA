# Hanzo MCP

An implementation of Hanzo capabilities using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

This project provides an MCP server that implements Hanzo-like functionality, allowing Claude to directly execute instructions for modifying and improving project files. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol, this implementation enables seamless integration with various MCP clients including Claude Desktop.

## Features

- **Code Understanding**: Analyze and understand codebases through file access and pattern searching
- **Code Modification**: Make targeted edits to files with proper permission handling
- **Enhanced Command Execution**: Run commands and scripts in various languages with improved error handling and shell support
- **File Operations**: Manage files with proper security controls through shell commands
- **Code Discovery**: Find relevant files and code patterns across your project
- **Project Analysis**: Understand project structure, dependencies, and frameworks
- **Agent Delegation**: Delegate complex tasks to specialized sub-agents that can work concurrently
- **Multiple LLM Provider Support**: Configure any LiteLLM-compatible model for agent operations
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Read and edit Jupyter notebooks with full cell and output handling

## Getting Started

### Quick Install

```bash
# Install using uv
uv pip install hanzo-mcp

# Or using pip
pip install hanzo-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

To install and configure hanzo-mcp for use with Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Install the package globally
uv pip install hanzo-mcp

# Install configuration to Claude Desktop with default settings
hanzo-mcp --install
```

For development, if you want to install your local version to Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the repository
git clone https://github.com/hanzoai/mcp.git
cd mcp

# Install and configure for Claude Desktop
make install-desktop

# With custom paths and server name
make install-desktop ALLOWED_PATHS="/path/to/projects,/another/path" SERVER_NAME="hanzo-dev"

# Disable write tools (useful if you prefer using your IDE for edits)
make install-desktop DISABLE_WRITE=1
```

After installation, restart Claude Desktop. You'll see "hanzo" (or your custom server name) available in the MCP server dropdown.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please refer to the [documentation](./docs/).

Of course, you can also read [USEFUL_PROMPTS](./docs/USEFUL_PROMPTS.md) for some inspiration on how to use hanzo-mcp.

## Security

This implementation follows best practices for securing access to your filesystem:

- Permission prompts for file modifications and command execution
- Restricted access to specified directories only
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling and reporting

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [docs](./docs/) directory. You can build and view the documentation locally:

```bash
# Build the documentation
make docs

# Start a local server to view the documentation
make docs-serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to view the documentation.
