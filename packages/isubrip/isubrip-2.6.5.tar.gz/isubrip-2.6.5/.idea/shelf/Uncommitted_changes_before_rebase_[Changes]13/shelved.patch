<+># Changelog\r\n## 2.6.4 [2025-06-13]\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Minor improvements to the download progress bar.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where if there is no config file, an error is raised instead of using default settings. ([Issue #86](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/86))\r\n---\r\n## 2.6.3 [2025-03-17]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where logs containing the percentage character (`%`) would raise an error. ([Issue #82](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/82))\r\n---\r\n## 2.6.2 [2025-02-04]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where AppleTV API calls would fail due to changes on AppleTV requiring a missing `utsk` parameter. ([Issue #80](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/80))\r\n* Fixed an issue where iTunes URLs would not work due to iTunes no longer redirecting to AppleTV. A different method will be used now to find corresponding AppleTV URLs. Also added a retry mechanism as it appears to be a bit unreliable at times. (thanks @yonatand1230 for suggesting this method!). ([Issue #78](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/78))\r\n* Removed progress bar when where there are no matching subtitles to download (previously, it would just show 0/0 with 0% progress).\r\n---\r\n## 2.6.1 [2025-01-31]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed a backwards compatibility issue in code, which would cause errors when running on Python versions lower than 3.12. ([Issue #78](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/78))\r\n---\r\n## 2.6.0 [2025-01-28]\r\n**The following update contains breaking changes to the config file.  \r\nIf you are using one, please update your config file accordingly.**\r\n\r\n### Added:\r\n* Added a new `general.log-level` config setting, the log level of stdout (console) output. Set to `info` by default. Can be changed to `debug`, `warning`, or `error`. See the updated [example config](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/example-config.toml) for an example.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Console output has been overhauled and improved, with colorful interactive output.\r\n* Config file is now parsed and validated in a more reliable and efficient manner. Configuration errors will now be more readable and descriptive.\r\n* **Breaking config changes** - the `scrapers` config category has been updated. Settings that should apply for all scrapers are now under the `scrapers.default` category instead of straight under `scrapers`. See the updated [example config](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/example-config.toml) for examples.\r\n* Updated AppleTV scraper request parameters.\r\n* Minor improvements to logs.\r\n* Python 3.8 is no longer supported. Minimum supported version has been updated to 3.9.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where if `verify-ssl` is set to `false`, and the `urllib3` package (which isn't a dependency of iSubRip) is not installed, an error could be thrown.\r\n---\r\n## 2.5.6 [2024-07-07]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where the update message from version `2.5.4` to `2.5.5` would still appear after updating.

See the updated [example config](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/blob/main/example-config.toml) for usage examples. ([Issue #71](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/71))\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Default timeout for requests has been updated from 5 seconds to 10 seconds. ([Issue #71](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/71))\r\n---\r\n## 2.5.4 [2024-04-28]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where if the `logs` directory does not exist, the folder isn't created, causing an error. ([Issue #67](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/67))\r\n* Fixed an issue where the summary log of successful and failed download would not account for failed downloads. ([Issue #68](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/68))\r\n---\r\n## 2.5.3 [2024-04-09]\r\n### Added:\r\n* Added new `proxy` and `verify-ssl` settings to the config file, for allowing the usage of a proxy when making requests, and disabling SSL verification.

([Issue #63](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/63))\r\n* Fixed an issue where the WebVTT Style blocks would have their `STYLE` tag replaced with a `REGION` tag in downloaded subtitles.\r\n* Fixed an issue where an empty playlist (with a size of 0 bytes) would be reported as a valid playlist with no matching subtitles. ([Issue #65](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/65))\r\n---\r\n## 2.5.2 [2024-01-06]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where errors would not be handled gracefully, and cause an unexpected crash. ([Issue #55](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/55))\r\n---\r\n## 2.5.1 [2023-12-23]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where source abbreviation was missing from file names of downloaded subtitles files.

See the new [Logs section in the README](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip#logs) for more information.\r\n* Added a new `subtitles.webvtt.subrip-alignment-conversion` config setting (which is off by default), which if set to true, will add the `{\\an8}` tag at the start of lines that are annotated at the top (with the `line:0.00%` WebVTT setting) when converting to SubRip. ([Issue #35](https://github.com/MichaelYochpaz/iSubRip/issues/35))\r\n* Implemented caching for AppleTV's storefront configuration data, which should reduce the amount of requests used when scraping multiple AppleTV URLs from the same storefront.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n* Big backend changes to the structure of the code, mostly to improve modularity and allow for easier development in the future, and improve performance.\r\n* Updated the CLI output to utilize logs and print with colors according to log-level.\r\n* Improved error handling in some cases where an invalid URL is used.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where if a movie is a pre-order with a set release date, a message with availability date wouldn't be printed in some cases.\r\n---\r\n## 2.4.3 [2023-06-18]\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n* Fixed an issue where some AppleTV URLs (or iTunes links that refer to such URLs) would not be matched in some cases, resulting in a \"No matching scraper was found...\" error.
