# This module provides fixtures and helpers for mocking asynchronous operations,
# especially network calls made during processes like chunk downloading.
# pytest-asyncio handles the event loop management.

# --- Example Fixture Structure (Implement based on iSubRip's download logic) ---

# @pytest.fixture
# def mock_chunk_downloader(mocker):
#     """
#     Mocks the core function/method responsible for downloading a single subtitle chunk.
#     This requires knowing the actual function path used for downloads (e.g., in httpx or a custom function).
#     """
#     # Example: Assume 'isubrip.some_module.actual_download_function' is the target
#     target_path = "isubrip.some_module.actual_download_function" # Replace with actual path
#
#     mock_download = AsyncMock()
#
#     # Configure the mock's behavior (e.g., simulate success, failure, delay)
#     async def fake_download_side_effect(*args, **kwargs):
#         # Simulate a tiny delay if needed
#         await asyncio.sleep(0.001)
#         # Return mock content (e.g., bytes representing a VTT chunk)
#         # This could potentially load data from mock_data_path based on args/kwargs
#         print(f"Mock download called with: args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}") # For debugging
#         return b"WEBVTT\\n\\n00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000\\nMock subtitle chunk\\n"

#     mock_download.side_effect = fake_download_side_effect
#
#     # Patch the target function using pytest's mocker fixture
#     patcher = mocker.patch(target_path, new=mock_download)
#     yield mock_download # Provide the mock object to the test if needed
#     patcher.stop() # Ensure the patch is cleaned up after the test

# Other potential fixtures/helpers:
# - Mocking higher-level download managers or pools if they exist.
# - Simulating specific network errors (e.g., timeouts, connection errors) during async operations.
