The budget control sheet will compute the Operating Units from the
Analytic accounts. Analytic accounts with no Operating Units assigned to
them will be accessible to all users with access to analytic accounts.
To configure the Operating Units for an Analytic account, follow these
steps:

1.  Go to Budgeting \> Configurations \> Analytic Accounts and add the
    accepted Operating Units to each analytic account.

Normally, budget transfer can only be made within the budget control's
Operating Unit. If you want to transfer across Operating Units, you can
talk with budget manager.

Note: The budget control must have only one Operating Unit from the
Analytic account.
