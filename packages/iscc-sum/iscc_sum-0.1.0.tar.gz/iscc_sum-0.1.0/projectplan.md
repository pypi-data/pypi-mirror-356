## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues and Mitigations

1. **PyPI Publishing Failure**

    - Mitigation: Have manual publishing steps ready
    - Fallback: Use `python -m build` and `twine upload`

2. **Version Sync Issues**

    - Mitigation: Double-check both Cargo.toml and pyproject.toml
    - Fallback: Manual version alignment

3. **CI/CD Modification Breaks**

    - Mitigation: Test on separate branch first
    - Fallback: Keep original workflow as backup

4. **Breaking Changes Discovered**

    - Mitigation: Comprehensive pre-release testing
    - Fallback: Quick patch release if needed

5. **Documentation Inaccuracies**

    - Mitigation: Test all examples before release
    - Fallback: Documentation hotfix PR

______________________________________________________________________

## Success Criteria

The release will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ Version 0.1.0 is published to PyPI
2. ✅ Users can install via `pip install iscc-sum`
3. ✅ All documented features work as advertised
4. ✅ Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
5. ✅ No critical issues reported within 48 hours
6. ✅ Documentation is accurate and complete

______________________________________________________________________

## Timeline Estimate

- Checkpoint 1: 2-3 hours (documentation updates)
- Checkpoint 2: 1-2 hours (version bump and cleanup)
- Checkpoint 3: 2-3 hours (CI/CD modifications and testing)
- Checkpoint 4: 2-3 hours (pre-release testing)
- Checkpoint 5: 1-2 hours (release execution)
- Checkpoint 6: 1-2 hours (post-release tasks)

**Total estimated time**: 9-15 hours

______________________________________________________________________

### Checkpoint 5 Progress Summary

#### Release Preparation Status

1. **Pre-release Checklist Verification**:
   - ✅ All checkpoints 1-4 completed successfully
   - ✅ No blocking issues identified
   - ✅ Test coverage at 100% (234 Python tests, 63 Rust tests)
   - ✅ All quality checks passing
   - ⏳ Awaiting team approval to proceed

2. **Branch Status**:
   - Currently on `release-0.1.0-workflow-mods` branch
   - Branch contains all necessary changes for v0.1.0 release
   - CI/CD modifications in place to skip crates.io publishing
   - Ready to merge to main for release

3. **Next Steps**:
   - ✅ Merged current branch to main
   - ✅ Pushed to trigger Release Please workflow
   - ⚠️ **Issue Found**: GitHub Actions lacks permissions to create PRs
   - **Action Required**: Repository settings need to be updated to allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests

4. **Alternative Manual Release Process**:
   Since Release Please cannot create PRs due to permissions, we can proceed with a manual release:
   - Create a git tag: `git tag v0.1.0`
   - Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
   - This will trigger the Release workflow to build and publish to PyPI
