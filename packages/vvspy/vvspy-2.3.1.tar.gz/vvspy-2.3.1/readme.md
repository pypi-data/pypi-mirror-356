# üöÇ VVS API Wrapper

[![PackageVersion][package_version_img]][package_version_img]
[![PythonVersions][python_versions_img]][python_versions_img]
[![License][repo_license_img]][repo_license_url]

**Fully object-oriented library** to integrate the **VVS API** into your project.

## Installation

```bash
pip install vvspy
```

## Examples

> [!TIP]
> For optimal performance on low-spec hardware such as Raspberry Pi, it is advisable to use the string values of the enum directly to avoid the overhead associated with loading the full enum.

- Detect delay in upcoming departures:

```python
from vvspy import get_departures
from vvspy.enums import Station

deps = get_departures(Station.HAUPTBAHNHOF__TIEF, limit=3)
for dep in deps:
    if dep.delay > 0:
        print("Alarm! Delay detected.")
        print(dep)  # [Delayed] [11:47] [RB17]: Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (oben) - Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof

    else:
        print("Train on time")
        print(dep)  # [11:47] [RB17]: Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (oben) - Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof
```

- Detect cancellations in upcoming departures/arrivals:

```python
from vvspy import get_departures
from vvspy.enums import Station

arrivals = get_departures(Station.VAIHINGEN, limit=5)

for arrival in arrivals:
    if arrival.cancelled:
        print(f"Alarm! The train at {arrival.real_datetime} has been cancelled!")
        # Check arrival.stop_infos and arrival.line_infos for more information
```

- Get complete trip info between two stations (including interchanges):

```python
from vvspy import get_trip  # also usable: get_trips
from vvspy.enums import Station

trip = get_trip(Station.HAUPTBAHNHOF__TIEF, Station.HARDTLINDE)

print(f"Duration: {trip.duration / 60} minutes")
for connection in trip.connections:
    print(f"From: {connection.origin.name} - To: {connection.destination.name}")
```

```text
# Output:
Duration: 58 minutes
From: Hauptbf (Arnulf-Klett-Platz) - To: Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (tief)
From: Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (tief) - To: Marbach (N)
From: Marbach (N) Bf - To: Murr Hardtlinde
```

- Filter for specific lines:

```python
from vvspy import get_departures
from vvspy.enums import Station

deps = get_departures(Station.HAUPTBAHNHOF__TIEF)
for dep in deps:
    if dep.serving_line.symbol == "S4":
        print(f"Departure of S4 at {dep.real_datetime}")
```

- Filter for specific platforms:

```python
from vvspy import get_departures
from vvspy.enums import Station

deps = get_departures(Station.HAUPTBAHNHOF__TIEF)
for dep in deps:
    if dep.platform == "101":
        print(f"Departure of {dep.serving_line.number} to {dep.serving_line.direction} on {dep.platform_name} at {dep.real_datetime}")
```

### Get your station id

See: [#64][station_id_issue_url]

### Logging

vvspy uses the python logging module. If you want to change the log level of vvspy, use the following:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger("vvspy")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
