LazyLabel is an intuitive, AI-assisted image segmentation tool. It uses Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for quick, precise mask generation, alongside advanced polygon editing for fine-tuned control. Outputs are saved in a clean, one-hot encoded `.npz` format for easy machine learning integration and in YOLO `.txt` format.

Inspired by [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and [Segment-Anything-UI](https://github.com/branislavhesko/segment-anything-ui/tree/main).

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **AI-Powered Segmentation**: Generate masks with simple left-click (positive) and right-click (negative) interactions.
* **Vector Polygon Tool**: Full control to draw, edit, and reshape polygons. Drag vertices or move entire shapes.
* **Advanced Class Management**: Assign multiple segments to a single class ID for organized labeling.
* **Intuitive Editing & Refinement**: Select, merge, and re-order segments.
* **Interactive UI**: Color-coded segments, sortable lists, and hover highlighting.
* **Smart I/O**: Loads existing `.npz` masks; saves work as clean, one-hot encoded outputs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
**Python 3.10**

### Installation

#### For Users [via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lazylabel-gui/)
1.  Install LazyLabel directly:
    ```bash
    pip install lazylabel-gui
    ```
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    lazylabel-gui
    ```

#### For Developers (from Source)
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dnzckn/LazyLabel.git
    cd LazyLabel
    ```
2.  Install in editable mode, which links the installed package to your source directory:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    lazylabel-gui
    ```

**Note**: On the first run, the application will automatically download the SAM model checkpoint (~2.5 GB) from Meta's repository to a local cache. This is a one-time download.

## üì¶ Output Format

LazyLabel saves your work as a compressed NumPy array (`.npz`) with the same name as your image file.

The file contains a single data key, `'mask'`, holding a **one-hot encoded tensor** with the shape `(H, W, C)`:
* `H`: Image height.
* `W`: Image width.
* `C`: Total unique classes.

Each channel is a binary mask for a class, combining all assigned segments into a clean, ML-ready output.
