## Q&A

### Why is it implemented through a widgetâ€™s canvas rather than just updating the widget's position?

Some widgets, such as `BoxLayout` and `GridLayout`, constrain the positions of their children, so updating a widget's position isn't always possible.

### Why doesn't it animate widget sizes?

It used to until version 0.1.x but this feature was dropped in version 0.2.0.
The reason is that scaling a widget using `kivy.graphics.Scale` produces visually unappealing results.
