Python bridge for the Java Native Interface.

Overview
========

| |package_bold| is a complete bridge between Python and Java JNI.
| It is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java JNI API.

`PyPI record`_.

`Documentation`_.

| |package_bold| is a lightweight Python package, based on the *ctypes*, or *cffi* library,
  or Cython wrapper (currently under development).
| It is done by implementing whole JNI API functionality in a clean Python instead of C/C++.
| |package_bold| also contains a JNI wrapper in pure C based on Python C-API (currently under
  development) - mainly for performance reasons.

What is |package|:
------------------

| |package_bold| is an effort to allow python programs full access to Java JNI API.
| This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython has done,
  but rather through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines.

Known Bugs/Limitations :
  * Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then restart it.

Installation
============

Prerequisites:

+ Python 3.10 or higher

Development
===========

Prerequisites:

+ Development is strictly based on *tox*. To install it run::
