For the following task, make plans that can solve the problem step by step. For each plan, indicate
which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence ot handoff and hand off details for the next agent. Evidence is the response from the tool.

Query: {query}

Tools available are:
{available_tools}

Available Agents for handoff:
{available_agents}

Respond with a list of plans, each plans in different cases have the JSON formats:

If you need to use a tool:
{tool_plan_structure}


If you need to hand off to another agent:
{agent_handoff_structure}

So, an example response can be:
[
    {tool_plan_structure},
    {tool_plan_structure},
]


An Example full task and plans, For example,
Task: Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week. Thomas worked x
hours. Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours
less than Toby. How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve
with Wolfram Alpha. Evidence 1 (#E1) = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x−10) + ((2x−10)−8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked. #E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked. #E3 = Calculator[(2 ∗#E2−10)−8]
