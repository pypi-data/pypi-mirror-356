# DHermes — Multi-Server, Multi-App Enviroments Orchestrator (DevOps-as-Code)

Hermes is a robust and extensible environment manager designed to orchestrate complex DevOps workflows across multiple servers, applications, and services.

It provides a DevOps-as-Code interface that simplifies:

- Infrastructure provisioning
- Application deployment
- Service lifecycle management
- Event-driven automation
- Secure multi-server credentials handling

Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Hermes allows teams to define environments declaratively using a lightweight DSL (YAML), enabling:

- Seamless coordination of distributed deployments
- Reusable, composable event hooks (e.g., onDeploy, onUpdate)
- Specific Environment server/app/service configurations
- Importable configuration modules for better DRY practices


## Use Cases
- Deploy microservices to different VMs with event-triggered hooks
- Spin up isolated dev/stage/prod environments with different configs
- Automate CI/CD operations per service/app/server or global
- Centralize infrastructure configuration in a single source of truth
