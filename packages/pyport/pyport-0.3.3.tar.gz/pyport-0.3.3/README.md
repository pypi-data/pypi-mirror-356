> **Simplify Your REST Interactions**  
> _A Python SDK for the Port IDP REST API that handles authentication, error handling, and logging so you can focus on building your solutions._


---

## 🔍 Overview

Modern REST APIs can be powerful—but they aren’t always intuitive to work with. **PyPort** abstracts away the repetitive tasks of authentication, error handling, and logging, providing you with a clean, Pythonic client interface to interact with the Port IDP REST API.

Whether you're writing custom Python scripts or building larger applications, PyPort is designed to speed up your development process by simplifying REST operations.

## Documentation & Support

For detailed information about the data model and code implementation, please refer to our comprehensive documentation at [PyPort Documentation](https://deepwiki.com/port-experimental/PyPort).

## Installation

Install PyPort using pip:

```bash
pip install pyport
```

## Usage
Below is a boilerplate example to help you get started with PyPort:

```python
import os
from pyport import PortClient

PORT_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("PORT_CLIENT_ID")
PORT_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("PORT_CLIENT_SECRET")

port_client = PortClient(client_id=PORT_CLIENT_ID, client_secret=PORT_CLIENT_SECRET, us_region=True)
blueprints = port_client.blueprints.get_blueprints()
``` 

Happy Coding!
