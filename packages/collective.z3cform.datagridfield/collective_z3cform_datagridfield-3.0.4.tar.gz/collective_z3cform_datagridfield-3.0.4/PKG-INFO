Introduction
============

Provides a field with a datagrid (table), where each row is a sub form.

It is a `z3c.form <https://z3cform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ implementation of the `Products.DataGridField <http://plone.org/products/datagridfield>`_ .

This product was developed for use with Plone and Dexterity.

   :target: https://github.com/collective/collective.z3cform.datagridfield/actions/workflows/test.yml


Installation
============

Add collective.z3cform.datagridfield to your buildout eggs:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.z3cform.datagridfield


Example usage
=============

This piece of code demonstrates a schema which has a table within it.
The layout of the table is defined by a second schema:

.. code-block:: python

    from collective.z3cform.datagridfield.datagridfield import DataGridFieldFactory
    from collective.z3cform.datagridfield.row import DictRow
    from plone.autoform.directives import widget
    from plone.autoform.form import AutoExtensibleForm
    from z3c.form import form
    from zope import interface
    from zope import schema


    class ITableRowSchema(interface.Interface):
        one = schema.TextLine(title=u"One")
        two = schema.TextLine(title=u"Two")
        three = schema.TextLine(title=u"Three")


    class IFormSchema(interface.Interface):
        four = schema.TextLine(title=u"Four")
        table = schema.List(
            title=u"Table",
            value_type=DictRow(
                title=u"tablerow",
                schema=ITableRowSchema,
            ),
        )

        widget(table=DataGridFieldFactory)


    class EditForm(AutoExtensibleForm, form.EditForm):
        label=u"Demo Usage of DataGridField"
        schema = IFormSchema


And configured via zcml:

.. code-block:: xml

    <browser:page
        name="editform--example"
        class=".editform.EditForm"
        for="*"
        permission="zope2.View"
        />


Also it can be used from a supermodel XML:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name="table" type="zope.schema.List">
      <description/>
      <title>Table</title>
      <value_type type="collective.z3cform.datagridfield.DictRow">
        <schema>your.package.interfaces.ITableRowSchema</schema>
      </value_type>
      <form:widget type="collective.z3cform.datagridfield.datagridfield.DataGridFieldFactory"/>
    </field>


Storage
-------

The data can be stored as either a list of dicts or a list of objects.
If the data is a list of dicts, the value_type is DictRow.
Otherwise, the value_type is 'schema.Object'.

If you are providing an Object content type (as opposed to dicts) you must provide your own conversion class.
The default conversion class returns a list of dicts,
not of your object class.
See the demos.


Configuration
=============


Row editor handles
------------------

Widget parameters can be passed via widget hints. Extended schema example from above:

.. code-block:: python

    class IFormSchema(interface.Interface):
        four = schema.TextLine(title=u"Four")
        table = schema.List(
            title=u"Table",
            value_type=DictRow(
                title=u"tablerow",
                schema=ITableRowSchema,
            ),
        )

        widget(
            "table",
            DataGridFieldFactory,
            allow_insert=False,
            allow_delete=False,
            allow_reorder=False,
            auto_append=False,
            display_table_css_class="table table-striped",
            input_table_css_class="table table-sm",
        )



Manipulating the Sub-form
-------------------------

The `DictRow` schema can also be extended via widget hints. Extended schema examples from above:

.. code-block:: python

    from z3c.form.browser.checkbox import CheckBoxFieldWidget


    class ITableRowSchema(interface.Interface):

        two = schema.TextLine(title=u"Level 2")

        address_type = schema.Choice(
            title="Address Type",
            required=True,
            values=["Work", "Home"],
        )
        # show checkboxes instead of selectbox
        widget(address_type=CheckBoxFieldWidget)


    class IFormSchema(interface.Interface):

        table = schema.List(
            title=u"Nested selection tree test",
            value_type=DictRow(
                title=u"tablerow",
                schema=ITableRowSchema
            )
        )
        widget(table=DataGridFieldFactory)


Working with plone.app.registry
-------------------------------

To use the field with plone.app.registry, you'll have to use
a version of the field that has PersistentField as it's base
class:

.. code-block:: python

    from collective.z3cform.datagridfield.registry import DictRow


JavaScript events
-----------------

``collective.z3cform.datagridfield`` fires jQuery events,
so that you can hook them in your own Javascript for DataGridField
behavior customization.

The following events are currently fired against ``table.datagridwidget-table-view``

* ``beforeaddrow`` [datagridfield, newRow]

* ``afteraddrow`` [datagridfield, newRow]

* ``beforeaddrowauto`` [datagridfield, newRow]

* ``afteraddrowauto`` [datagridfield, newRow]

* ``aftermoverow`` [datagridfield]

* ``afterdatagridfieldinit`` - All DGFs on the page have been initialized

Example usage:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var handleDGFInsert = function(event, dgf, row) {
        row = $(row);
        console.log("Got new row:");
        console.log(row);
    };

    // Bind all DGF handlers on the page
    $(document).on('beforeaddrow beforeaddrowauto', '.datagridwidget-table-view', handleDGFInsert);

2.0 (2021-03-29)
----------------

- Register new pat-datagridfield bundle.

  Breaking change:
  The JavaScript resources have changed a lot.
  Please run the provided upgrade steps!

  If you were customizing templates which loaded these JavaScript resources
  or customized the JavaScript functionality itself, take special care.
  The bundle is loaded only for logged-in users.

- Rework JavaScript as a Pattern for better initialization.

- Row UI buttons optimizations
  Change row UI elements from anchor to buttons for better semantics.
  Fix Bootstrap classes, remove unused attributes, add a title to buttons.
  [thet]

- Change UI element classes

  Remove non-unique id attributes from UI buttons and add classes instead.
  Let the button functionality be initialized by the pattern.

  Breaking change:
    In this version a pattern handles all the JavaScript functionality to ensure best possible encapsulation between different instances of the datagridfield widget.
    If you have customized templates, make sure you do the following:

    - Add the class ``pat-datagridfield`` to the ``datagridwidget-table-view`` nodes (datagridfield_input.pt, datagridfield_input_block.pt).
    - Add the following classes instead of ids to the ui buttons as shown in this map (datagridfieldobject_input.pt, datagridfieldobject_input_block.pt):

      - #btn-addrow -> .dgf--row-add
      - #btn-deleterow -> .dgf--row-delete
      - #btn-moveup -> .dgf--row-moveup
      - #btn-movedown -> .dgf--row-movedown

  [neilferreira]

- Stopped referencing the 'event' element when creating a new row as the event
  that triggered the content of an input changing may have been from another element.
  [neilferreira]


1.0 (2014-06-02)
----------------

- Add 'form-widgets-field_id' as widget css id (consistency with other widgets).
  [thomasdesvenain]

  [gaudenz]


0.15 (2013-09-24)
-----------------

- Added possibility to define the CSS class for the main table when the field is displayed.
  This way, you can use common Plone existing classes (like 'listing').
  [gbastien]

- Fixed auto-append bug when there is more than one datagrid field in page auto-appending one field binds
  "change.dgf" to another field also. added "$(dgf).find(.." in datagridfield.js line 138 so it binds to right element only.
  [tareqalam]

- Only abort moveRow if the row is really not found and not if the row idx just happens to be 0.
  [gaudenz]

- Also update hidden data rows when reindexing in row mode. This fix was previously somehow only done for block mode.
  [gaudenz]

- Relax requirements for markup, don't assume inputs are direct children of table cells. This makes using custom
  templates much easier.
  [gaudenz]

- Fix validate function signature for IValidator API. The API requires a "force" argument.
  [gaudenz]

- Register the SubformAdapter for IPloneForm layer to avoid that the Adapter from plone.app.z3cform

- Fix to expect ``zope.schema.interfaces.ValidationError`` to work better
  with *TooLong* and *TooShort* exceptions. [datakurre]

- Fix IE7 failing on `<label>` for manipulation [miohtama]

- Deal with situations where there is zero rows on DGF and no auto-append row available [miohtama]

- Correctly bind DGF events on DOM content loaded, not when Javascript is parsed [miohtama]

- Don't display movement handles if the row cannot be moved [miohtama]

- Changed move up and down handlers to stay in fixed positions to make cells stay in the same width regardless of moving [miohtama]

- Nested DataGridField support (yo dawg...) [miohtama]

- Support plone.autoform and grok'ed row schemas [miohtama]

- Added ``DataGridField.extra`` parameter, so you can pass out
  application specific data to Javascript [miohtama]


0.11 (2012-05-16)
-----------------

- be able to use with plone.app.registry
  [vangheem]


0.10 (2012-02-12)
-----------------

- Fix bug with moving the last row up.
  [m-martinez]


0.9 (2011-10-27)
----------------

- Clone events when adding new row - fixes bug where browse button of
  plone.formwidget.contenttree did nothing for new rows
  [anthonygerrard]

- Reindex more indexed attributes of cloned row
  [anthonygerrard]


0.8 (2011-09-24)
----------------

- Avoid using the "row" CSS class.
  [davisagli]

- Fixes to work with jQuery 1.3.x (use .remove() instead of .detach(), fetch data
  attributes a different way, and avoid live binding the change event).
  [davisagli]

- Don't error out when getting a ``FormatterValidationError``, pass
  it on to z3c.form instead.
  [claytron]

- Give manipulator images a relative src rather than absolute. This
  previously meant the widget didn't work on sites without Plone/Zope at the
  root of the domain.
  [davidjb]

- During auto-insert, add our new row into the document first, before reindexing
  it and changing its elements' IDs. This allows Javascript that depends on
  these IDs (such as plone.formwidget.autocomplete) to pick up the correct
  fields.
  [davidjb]

- Tidying up and reducing complexity of auto-insert functionality
  [davidjb]

- Removing unnecessary auto-insert bind and unbind as this is already covered
  by jQuery's `live()` function against the `auto-append` class. Adding/removing
  this class against rows automatically does this.
  [davidjb]

- Resolved issue with auto-insert functionality not working by removing
  table-specific check in Javascript.
  [davidjb]


0.7 (2011-07-01)
----------------

- Changed markup/javascript to prevent duplicate HTML id attributes. Changed
  Javascript to allow for datagrid page templates that don't use tables.
  [dextermilo]

- Improve spacing in CSS.
  [davisagli]

- Revert my fix to ensure that blank rows are added, because it duplicated
  a fix in z3c.form resulting in extra rows.
  [davisagli]


0.6 (2011-05-17)
----------------

- Search for datagridInitialise and datagridUpdateWidgets on the
  parent form, also when in a fieldset.
  [maurits]

- Register templates on plone.app.z3cform.interfaces.IPloneFormLayer to
  take precedence over that packages list widget templates.
  [elro]

- Make sure that updateWidgets is called to add blank rows even if the
  widget has no value.
  [davisagli]

- When extracting a row value fails due to a validation error, convert
  widget values to field values so the value can be successfully applied
  to the grid widget.
  [davisagli]

- Register a plone.supermodel handler for the DictRow so it can be used
  in supermodel models.
  [davisagli]

- Depend on collective.z3cform.datagridfield_demo as a test extra;
  use the browser view from this package in the tests.
  [maurits]

- _validate still used when import/exporting, fix up code so it works
  [lentinj]

- Add a DictRow serializer for transmogrify.dexterity
  [lentinj]

- Only use width:100% on input cells that are the only element in the cell
  [lentinj]

- Reorder row indices backwards when adding rows. This means that adjacent
  rows don't share the same index temporarily, for example:-
  - Row 1 and 2 contain input:radio based widgets
  - Row 0 added, row renumbering starts
  - Row 1 widgets renamed 2
  - Both sets of input:radio share the same name, one deselected
  - Row 2 widgets renamed 3
  - . . .
  [lentinj]

- Use jQuery to clone rows, and clone the jQuery events on the rows.
  [lentinj]

- Implemented reorder functionality


0.5 (2011-02-08)
----------------

- Put in the DictRow class (tks Martin Aspeli)

- Moved the demo code out to a separate package collective.z3cform.datagridfield_demo
  (tks Laurence Rowe).

- Removed superfluous lines from setup.py (tks Laurence Rowe).

- Removed unnecessary dependency on dexterity (tks Laurence Rowe).

- Removed unnecessary dependency on grok (tks Laurence Rowe).


0.4 (2011-02-06)
----------------

- Renamed the demo pages. The starting point is now @@demo-collective.z3cform.datagrid .

- The widget can now be configured via the updateWidgets method. It
  is no longer necessary to create a custom factory.

0.3 (2011-02-04)
----------------

- The auto-append functionality did not bind correctly for popup forms.
  I switched to using jQuery.live() instead of binding at document load time.

- Added a menu to the demo pages

- Added a display only form option.

- Fixed the restructured text of the main README.txt so that it will show
  more friendly in PyPI.
