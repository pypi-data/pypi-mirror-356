# Summary

Propagation of uncertainties is of great utility in the experimental sciences.
While the rules of (linear) uncertainty propagation are straightforward, managing many 
variables with uncertainty information can quickly become complicated in large 
scientific software stacks. Often, this requires programmers to keep track of many variables 
and implement custom error propagation rules for each mathematical operator and function. 
The Python package `AutoUncertainties`, described here, provides a solution to this problem.


# Statement of Need

`AutoUncertainties` is a Python package for uncertainty propagation of independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. It provides a drop-in mechanism to add uncertainty information 
to Python scalar and `NumPy` [@harris2020array] array objects. It implements manual propagation rules 
for the Python dunder math methods, and uses automatic differentiation via `JAX` [@jax2018github] to propagate 
uncertainties for most `NumPy` methods applied to both scalar and `NumPy` array variables. In doing so,
it eliminates the need for carrying around additional uncertainty variables or for implementing custom
propagation rules for any `NumPy` operator with a gradient rule implemented by `JAX`. Furthermore, in 
most cases, it requires minimal modification to existing codeâ€”typically only when uncertainties are 
attached to central values.


# Prior Work

To the author's knowledge, the only existing error propagation library in Python is the `uncertainties` 
[@lebigot2024] package, which inspired the current work. While extremely useful, the `uncertainties` 
package relies on hand-implemented rules and functions for uncertainty propagation of array and scalar data. 
This is mostly trivial for Python's intrinsic arithmetic and logical operations such as `__add__`, however it becomes 
problematic for more advanced mathematical operations. For instance, calculating the uncertainty propagation due to 
the cosine function requires the import of separate math libraries, rather than being able to use `NumPy` directly.

```python
# Using uncertainties v3.2.3
import numpy as np
from uncertainties import unumpy, ufloat
arr = np.array([ufloat(1, 0.1), ufloat(2, 0.002)])
unumpy.cos(arr)  # calculation succeeds
np.cos(arr)      # raises an exception
```

The example above illustrates a primary limitation of the `uncertainties` package: arrays of 
`ufloat` objects cannot be seamlessly integrated with common `NumPy` functions, and can only
be operated on by the `unumpy` suite of functions.


# Implementation

For a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ of $n$ i.i.d. 
variables, linear uncertainty propagation can be computed via the simple rule 
$$ \delta f_j (\mathbf x)^2 = \sum_i^n \left(\dfrac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i} \delta x_i \right)^2, \quad\quad j \in [1, m].$$

To compute $\dfrac{\partial f_j}{\partial x_i}$ for arbitrary $f$, the implementation in `AutoUncertainties` relies on
automatic differentiaion provided by `JAX`. Calls to any `NumPy` array function or universal function (ufunc) are 
intercepted via the `__array_function__` and `__array_ufunc__` mechanism, and dispatched to a `NumPy` wrapper routine 
that computes the Jacobian matrix via `jax.jacfwd`.

The user API for the `Uncertainty` object exposes a number of properties and methods, of which some of the most 
important are:

- `value -> float`: The central value of the object.
- `error -> float`: The error (standard deviation) of the object.
- `relative -> float`: The relative error (i.e. error / value) of the object.
- `plus_minus(self, err: float) -> Uncertainty`: Adds error (in quadrature).

These attributes and methods can be used in the following manner:

```python
from auto_uncertainties import Uncertainty
u1 = Uncertainty(5.25, 0.75)
u2 = Uncertainty(1.85, 0.4)

print(u1)                  # 5.25 +/- 0.75
print(u1.value)            # 5.25
print(u1.error)            # 0.75
print(u1.relative)         # 0.142857
print(u1.plus_minus(0.5))  # 5.25 +/- 0.901388

# Construct a vector Uncertainty from a sequence.
seq = Uncertainty([u1, u2]) 
print(seq.value)  # [5.25 1.85]
print(seq.error)  # [0.75 0.4 ]
```

Of course, one of the most important aspects of `AutoUncertainties` is its seamless support for `NumPy`:

```python
import numpy as np
from auto_uncertainties import Uncertainty
vals = np.array([0.5, 0.75])
errs = np.array([0.05, 0.3])
u = Uncertainty(vals, errs)

print(np.cos(u))  # [0.877583 +/- 0.0239713, 0.731689 +/- 0.204492]
```

This is in contrast to the `uncertainties` package, which would have necessitated using the 
`unumpy` module of hand-implemented `NumPy` function analogs.

The `Uncertainty` class automatically determines which methods should be implemented based on 
whether it represents a vector uncertainty, or a scalar uncertainty. When instantiated with
sequences or `NumPy` arrays, vector-based operations are enabled; when instantiated with scalars,
only scalar operations are permitted. 

`AutoUncertainties` also provides certain exceptions, helper functions, accessors, and display 
rounding adjustors, whose details can be found in the [documentation](https://autouncertainties.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 


## Support for Pint

`AutoUncertainties` provides some support for working with objects from the `Pint` package [@pint]. 
For example, `Uncertainty` objects can be instantiated from `pint.Quantity` objects, and then 
automatically wrapped into new `pint.Quantity` objects via the `from_quantities` method. This 
guarantees that unit information is preserved when moving between `Uncertainty` objects and
`pint.Quantity` objects.

```python
from auto_uncertainties import Uncertainty
from pint import Quantity

val = Quantity(2.24, 'kg')
err = Quantity(0.208, 'kg')
new_quantity = Uncertainty.from_quantities(val, err)

print(new_quantity)        # 2.24 +/- 0.208 kilogram
print(type(new_quantity))  # <class 'pint.Quantity'>
```


# Current Limitations and Future Work

## Dependent Random Variables

To simplify operations on `Uncertainty` objects, `AutoUncertainties` assumes all variables are independent
and normally distributed. This means that, in the case where the programmer assumes dependence
between two or more `Uncertainty` objects, unexpected and counter-intuitive behavior may arise during 
uncertainty propagation. This is a common pitfall when working with `Uncertainty` objects, especially since 
the package will not prevent users from manipulating variables in a manner that implies dependence. Examples 
of this behavior, along with certain potential workarounds, can be found [here](https://autouncertainties.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#current-limitations-and-future-work) 
in the documentation. In general, most binary operations involving the same variable twice will 
produce undesired results (for instance, performing `X - X`, where `X` is an `Uncertainty` object, will
*not* result in a standard deviation of zero).

The workarounds are nevertheless cumbersome, and cause `AutoUncertainties` to fall somewhat short of the original
goals of automated error propagation. In principle, this could be addressed by storing a full computational
graph of the result of chained operations, similar to what is done in `uncertainties`. However, the complexity
of such a system places it out of scope for `AutoUncertainties` at this time.
