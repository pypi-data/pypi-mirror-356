## Architecture and Design

The video downloader is built around the principle of single responsibility, with each class handling a specific aspect of the download process. This design promotes testability, maintainability, and allows for easy extension and modification of individual components.

### Architecture Overview

The module implements a layered architecture with clear separation between:

1. **Information Layer** (`VideoInfoExtractor`):
   * Extracts video metadata without downloading content.
   * Validates video availability and accessibility.
   * Retrieves video information for processing decisions.

2. **Execution Layer** (`DownloadExecutor`):
   * Handles actual download operations.
   * Manages interactions and configurations with `yt-dlp`.
   * Provides robust error handling for download failures.

3. **Orchestration Layer** (`DownloaderCore`):
   * Coordinates the complete download workflow.
   * Integrates all components and manages dependencies.
   * Ensures proper resource lifecycle management and cleanup.
   * Manages file system operations and maintains download statistics.

### Key Components

* `VideoInfoExtractor`: Metadata extraction and validation.
* `DownloadExecutor`: Core download execution engine.
* `DownloaderCore`: Main orchestrator and workflow manager.

### Design Patterns

The architecture utilizes several well-known design patterns:

* **Strategy Pattern**: Format selection through `IFormatStrategy` interface.
* **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies injected through constructor parameters.
* **Context Manager**: Resource management implemented using `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
* **Facade Pattern**: `DownloaderCore` provides a simplified interface to complex operations.
* **Template Method**: Standardized download workflow with extensible, customizable steps.

### Error Handling Philosophy

The module emphasizes defensive programming practices:

* External API calls wrapped in try-catch blocks.
* Errors logged comprehensively without crashing the application.
* Graceful handling and logging of individual download failures.
* Resource cleanup guaranteed through context managers.
* Detailed error messages for easy troubleshooting and debugging.

### Performance Considerations

* Efficient metadata extraction without unnecessary downloads.
* File existence checking to avoid redundant operations.
* Resource pooling and cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
* Asynchronous design for concurrent operations.
* Minimal I/O operations through intelligent caching strategies.

### Integration Points

The module integrates smoothly with several external systems:

* **yt-dlp**: Core download engine and interface to video platforms.
* **File System**: Abstracted through `IFileChecker` interface.
* **Logging**: Managed through `ILogger` interface for monitoring and debugging.
* **Statistics**: Download progress tracking via `IStatsCollector`.
* **Configuration**: User preferences and settings via `Config` class.
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Localized user feedback through `Messages`.

### Usage Patterns

The module supports multiple usage scenarios:

1. **Single Download Operations**:
   * Extract video information.
   * Check file existence.
   * Execute download if necessary.
   * Update statistics and logs.

2. **Batch Download Operations**:
   * Concurrent processing of multiple URLs.
   * Aggregate and track statistics across operations.
   * Graceful handling of individual download failures.

### Security Considerations

* Robust input validation for URLs and file paths.
* Safe filename sanitization to prevent directory traversal attacks.
* Secure handling of temporary files and downloaded content.
* Validation and sanitization of video metadata.
* Protection mechanisms against malicious URLs and potentially harmful content.

### Thread Safety

* `VideoInfoExtractor`: Thread-safe; each instance creates isolated yt-dlp sessions.
* `DownloadExecutor`: Thread-safe; each operation is isolated.
* `DownloaderCore`: Not thread-safe; designed to operate within single-thread contexts.
* Resource Management: Requires careful handling and coordination in multi-threaded environments.

## Installation

The package requires **Python 3.8** or newer.

The project is actively developed and tested on Python **3.12**, so using this version is recommended for maximum stability.
Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install yt_dl_cli
```

## Dependencies

* **yt-dlp** â€“ Core library for downloading videos.

## Usage

### Quick Start

Install and download a video in one go:

```bash
pip install yt-dl-cli
yt-dl-cli --urls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

### Command-line interface

```bash
yt-dl-cli --urls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --quality 720 --dir videos
```

### Available CLI Options

| Option               | Description                              | Example Value          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `-f`, `--file`       | File containing URLs (one per line)      | `links.txt`            |
| `-d`, `--dir`        | Directory to save downloaded files       | `my_videos`            |
| `-w`, `--workers`    | Number of concurrent download workers    | `4`                    |
| `-q`, `--quality`    | Video quality preference                 | `best`, `720`, `480`   |
| `-a`, `--audio-only` | Download audio only                      | (flag)                 |
| `--urls`             | URLs provided directly via CLI           | `<YouTube URL>`        |

Example:

```bash
yt-dl-cli -f links.txt -d my_videos -w 4 -q best
```

### Argument Validation

The command-line interface of `yt-dl-cli` uses strict argument validation to ensure safe and predictable behavior. All arguments are checked and sanitized before any download or file operation begins, preventing partial operations if validation fails.

#### What is Validated?

| Argument      | Validation Details                                                                                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--file`      | Must be a readable file, not empty, with one URL per line (comments and blank lines are ignored).      |
| `--dir`       | Must be a valid directory. The directory will be created if it does not exist, provided the parent directory is writable. Otherwise, a permission error is raised. |
| `--workers`   | Must be an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive).                                                      |
| `--quality`   | Must be one of: `best`, `worst`, `1080`, `720`, `480`, `360`.                                         |
| `--urls`      | Each URL must start with `http://` or `https://` and point to a platform supported by `yt-dlp` (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo). |

If any validation fails, the program will print a clear error message and exit. Edge cases, such as empty URL files or excessively long URLs, are handled with appropriate error messages.

#### Examples

* Invalid workers value

```bash
yt-dl-cli --workers 20
# Error: Workers must be between 1 and 10.
```

* Invalid quality value

```bash
yt-dl-cli --quality 999
# Error: Quality must be one of ['best', 'worst', '1080', '720', '480', '360'], got '999'.
```

* Invalid URL in file (e.g., ftp://example.com in links.txt):

If your links file contains something like ftp://example.com:

```bash
yt-dl-cli --file links.txt
# Error: Invalid URL 'ftp://example.com'. URLs must start with 'http://' or 'https://'.
```

* File does not exist

```bash
yt-dl-cli --file missing.txt
# Error: URL file 'missing.txt' does not exist or is not a file.
```

* Directory is not writable

```bash
yt-dl-cli --dir /root
# Error: Invalid directory '/root': [Permission denied...]
```

#### Implementation Notes

* All argument validation is performed before starting any download or file operation.
* Custom error messages provide context for each failure.
* The validation logic is modular and can be extended if new options are added.

You can see the full validation logic in **yt_dl_cli/utils/validators.py**.
