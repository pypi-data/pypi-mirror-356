"""
YT-DL-CLI Video Downloader Main Application Module.

This module contains the primary VideoDownloader class that serves as the main
orchestrator for the entire video downloading process. It integrates all
components of the application including configuration management, dependency
injection, asynchronous orchestration, and comprehensive error handling.

The module is designed with a clean architecture approach, separating concerns
between configuration, logging, orchestration, and execution. It provides a
high-level interface that abstracts away the complexity of concurrent downloads,
internationalization, and error management.

Key Features:
    - Command-line argument parsing and configuration management
    - Dependency injection for clean component integration
    - Asynchronous download orchestration for optimal performance
    - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
    - Internationalization support for multi-language environments
    - Graceful handling of user interruptions and system errors

Architecture:
    The module follows the dependency injection pattern to ensure loose coupling
    between components. The VideoDownloader class acts as a facade that coordinates
    between different subsystems without being tightly coupled to their implementations.

    The application architecture consists of several layers:

    1. Presentation Layer (CLI Interface):
       - Command-line argument parsing
       - User interaction and feedback
       - Progress reporting and error messages

    2. Application Layer (Main Orchestration):
       - VideoDownloader class (main entry point)
       - Configuration management and validation
       - High-level workflow coordination

    3. Domain Layer (Business Logic):
       - AsyncOrchestrator for concurrent operations
       - Download core functionality
       - Business rules and validation

    4. Infrastructure Layer (External Dependencies):
       - File system operations
       - Network communication
       - Logging and monitoring
       - Internationalization services

Design Patterns:
    - Facade Pattern: VideoDownloader provides simplified interface to complex subsystems
    - Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling and enhances testability
    - Context Manager: Ensures proper resource management and cleanup
    - Observer Pattern: Progress tracking and event notification
    - Strategy Pattern: Multiple download strategies and quality options

Error Handling Strategy:
    The module implements a comprehensive error handling approach:

    - Graceful Degradation: Continues operation when possible, falls back to defaults
    - User-Friendly Messages: Translates technical errors into understandable feedback
    - Logging Hierarchy: Different log levels for different audiences (user vs developer)
    - Resource Cleanup: Ensures proper cleanup even in error scenarios
    - Interruption Handling: Responds appropriately to user cancellation requests

Performance Considerations:
    - Asynchronous I/O operations to prevent blocking
    - Concurrent downloads with configurable limits
    - Memory-efficient streaming for large files
    - Progress tracking without performance impact
    - Lazy loading of heavy dependencies

Internationalization:
    The module supports multiple languages through the i18n system:
    - Dynamic language detection from system locale
    - Runtime language switching capability
    - Localized error messages and user feedback
    - Cultural adaptation of date/time formats
    - Support for right-to-left languages

Security Considerations:
    - Input validation for URLs and file paths
    - Safe file naming to prevent directory traversal
    - Secure temporary file handling
    - Network request validation and sanitization
    - Proper handling of sensitive configuration data

Example Usage:
    Command-line usage:

    $ python main.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" --quality 720p
    $ python main.py --playlist "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=example" --format mp3
    $ python main.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" --save-dir "/custom/path"

    Programmatic usage:

    >>> from main import VideoDownloader
    >>>

class VideoDownloader:
    """
    Main orchestrator class for the YouTube video downloading application.

    This class serves as the primary entry point and coordinator for the entire
    download process. It encapsulates the complexity of managing configuration,
    dependency injection, asynchronous orchestration, and error handling while
    providing a simple interface for initiating downloads.

    The class follows the facade pattern, providing a simplified interface to
    a complex subsystem of downloaders, parsers, loggers, and orchestrators.
    It ensures proper initialization order, resource management, and graceful
    error handling throughout the application lifecycle.

    Responsibilities:
        1. Parse and validate command-line arguments
        2. Initialize configuration and logging systems
        3. Create and configure the dependency injection container
        4. Orchestrate asynchronous download operations
        5. Handle user interruptions and system errors gracefully
        6. Manage resource cleanup and proper shutdown procedures

    Design Patterns:
        - Facade: Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems
        - Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling and testability
        - Context Manager: Ensures proper resource management

    Thread Safety:
        This class is not thread-safe by design. Each instance should be used
        in a single thread context. For concurrent operations, the class
        delegates to AsyncOrchestrator which handles async/await patterns.

    Attributes:
        config (Config): Application configuration object containing all
                        settings for download operations, paths, and preferences.
        logger (logging.Logger): Configured logger instance for the application,
                               set up with appropriate handlers and formatters.

    Example:
        Basic usage with default configuration:

        >>> downloader = VideoDownloader()
        >>> downloader.download()

        Usage with custom configuration:

        >>> custom_config = Config(save_dir="/custom/path", quality="1080p")
        >>> custom_logger = logging.getLogger("custom")
        >>> downloader = VideoDownloader(config=custom_config, logger=custom_logger)
        >>> downloader.download()

        """
        Initialize the VideoDownloader with configuration and logging setup.

        This constructor sets up the fundamental components required for the
        download process. It allows for dependency injection of configuration
        and logger objects, falling back to defaults when not provided.

        The initialization process follows a specific order to ensure proper
        component dependencies:
        1. Initialize internationalization system with specified language
        2. Parse or accept configuration parameters
        3. Set up logging infrastructure with appropriate handlers
        4. Prepare the instance for download operations

        The constructor is designed to be lightweight and perform minimal I/O
        operations. Heavy initialization tasks are deferred to the download()
        method to keep object creation fast and predictable.

        Args:
            config (Optional[Config], optional): Pre-configured Config object
                containing application settings such as save directory, quality
                preferences, format options, and network settings. If None,
                configuration will be parsed from command-line arguments using
                parse_arguments(). This allows for both programmatic and
                command-line usage patterns. Defaults to None.

            logger (Optional[logging.Logger], optional): Pre-configured logger
                instance for application logging. Should be configured with
                appropriate handlers, formatters, and log levels. If None,
                a new logger will be created using LoggerFactory with the
                save directory from config as the base path for log files.
                Defaults to None.

            language (Optional[str], optional): ISO 639-1 language code for
                internationalization (e.g., 'en', 'ru', 'de', 'fr', 'es').
                Determines the language for user interface messages, error
                messages, and logging output. If None, the system will attempt
                to detect the appropriate language from system locale settings.
                Defaults to None.

        Raises:
            ConfigurationError: Raised when the provided config object contains
                               invalid settings, required fields are missing,
                               or command-line argument parsing fails due to
                               invalid arguments or conflicting options.

            LoggerInitializationError: Raised when logger setup fails due to
                                     insufficient permissions for log file
                                     creation, invalid log directory paths,
                                     or logging configuration errors.

            ImportError: Raised when required dependencies for internationalization
                        (i18n modules) or core components are not available.
                        This typically indicates an incomplete installation.

            ValueError: Raised when an invalid language code is provided that
                       is not supported by the internationalization system.

        Side Effects:
            - Initializes the global internationalization system
            - May create configuration files if they don't exist
            - Sets up logging handlers that may create log files
            - Registers signal handlers for graceful shutdown
            - May modify global locale settings

        Performance Notes:
            - Constructor execution time is typically < 50ms
            - Memory usage is minimal until download() is called
            - No network requests are made during initialization
            - File system access is limited to configuration and log setup

        Example:
            Default initialization (uses command-line arguments):

            >>> downloader = VideoDownloader()
            >>> # Configuration parsed from sys.argv
            >>> # Logger uses default settings
            >>> # Language detected from system locale

            Custom configuration with dependency injection:

            >>> config = Config(
            ...     save_dir="/downloads",
            ...     quality="720p",
            ...     format="mp4",
            ...     max_concurrent=3
            ... )
            >>> downloader = VideoDownloader(config=config)

            Full customization with all parameters:

            >>> import logging
            >>>
            >>> # Custom logger with specific configuration
            >>> logger = logging.getLogger("my_downloader")
            >>> logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
            >>>
            >>> # Custom configuration
            >>> config = Config(save_dir="/custom/downloads")
            >>>
            >>> # Initialize with Russian language
            >>> downloader = VideoDownloader(
            ...     config=config,
            ...     logger=logger,
            ...     language="ru"
            ... )

        Note:
            The constructor establishes the foundation for the download process
            but does not initiate any downloads. The actual download process
            begins when the download() method is called. This separation allows
            for configuration validation and setup verification before starting
            potentially long-running operations.

        Execute the complete video download process with comprehensive error handling.

        This method orchestrates the entire download workflow from initialization
        to completion. It serves as the main entry point for the download process,
        coordinating between multiple subsystems including dependency injection,
        asynchronous orchestration, resource management, and error handling.

        The method implements a sophisticated error handling strategy that provides
        different responses for different types of failures, ensuring graceful
        degradation and proper user feedback. It uses context managers to guarantee
        resource cleanup regardless of how the process terminates.

        Process Architecture:
            The download process follows a well-defined workflow:

            1. **Dependency Resolution**: Creates the downloader core through the
               dependency injection container, ensuring all required components
               are properly initialized and configured.

            2. **Orchestrator Setup**: Initializes the AsyncOrchestrator with the
               core components and configuration, preparing for concurrent operations.

            3. **Resource Management**: Enters a context manager that ensures proper
               resource allocation and cleanup, including file handles, network
               connections, and temporary files.

            4. **Asynchronous Execution**: Launches the main download orchestration
               using asyncio, enabling concurrent downloads and efficient I/O operations.

            5. **Completion Handling**: Manages successful completion, user interruption,
               or error scenarios with appropriate logging and cleanup procedures.

        Error Handling Strategy:
            The method implements a multi-layered error handling approach:

            - **User Interruption (KeyboardInterrupt)**: Caught when the user presses
              Ctrl+C or sends SIGINT. Logs a localized warning message and performs
              graceful shutdown, allowing for cleanup of partial downloads and
              temporary files.

            - **Critical System Errors (Exception)**: Catches all other unexpected
              exceptions, logs them as critical errors with full stack traces for
              debugging, and terminates the application with a non-zero exit code
              to indicate failure to calling processes.

            - **Resource Management**: The context manager pattern ensures that
              resources are properly cleaned up even if exceptions occur during
              the download process, preventing resource leaks and corruption.

        Concurrency and Performance:
            - Utilizes asyncio event loop for efficient concurrent operations
            - Delegates heavy I/O operations to specialized async components
            - Implements proper backpressure handling to prevent memory exhaustion
            - Provides real-time progress tracking without performance overhead
            - Manages connection pooling and rate limiting for optimal throughput

        Returns:
            None: This method operates through side effects and does not return
                 a value. Success is indicated by completion without exceptions,
                 while failures are communicated through logging, user messages,
                 and appropriate exit codes for process management.

        Raises:
            SystemExit: May be raised by underlying components for critical errors
                       that require immediate application termination. This typically
                       occurs for configuration errors, permission issues, or
                       unrecoverable system states. The exit code indicates the
                       type of failure for process management and scripting.

        Side Effects:
            File System:
                - Creates downloaded video/audio files in the configured directory
                - Generates temporary files during the download process
                - Creates and updates log files with operation details
                - May create directory structures for organized storage

            Network:
                - Establishes connections to video hosting services
                - Downloads video metadata and content streams
                - May configure proxy settings and authentication
                - Implements rate limiting and retry mechanisms

            User Interface:
                - Displays progress indicators and download statistics
                - Shows real-time status updates and completion notifications
                - Provides error messages and troubleshooting information
                - Updates terminal title and status (where supported)

            System Resources:
                - Manages memory usage for concurrent operations
                - Utilizes available CPU cores for parallel processing
                - Monitors disk space and prevents over-allocation
                - Handles system signals for graceful shutdown

        Performance Characteristics:
            - **Memory Usage**: Scales with concurrent download count and video quality
            - **CPU Usage**: Minimal except during transcoding operations
            - **Network Usage**: Optimized with connection pooling and compression
            - **Disk I/O**: Efficient streaming writes to minimize disk thrashing
            - **Response Time**: Real-time progress updates every 100ms

        Example Usage:
            Basic download execution:

            >>> downloader = VideoDownloader()
            >>> downloader.download()
            # Output: Progress bars, status messages, completion notification

            Error handling in scripts:

            >>> import sys
            >>> try:
            ...     downloader = VideoDownloader()
            ...     downloader.download()
            ...     print("Download completed successfully")
            ... except SystemExit as e:
            ...     print(f"Download failed with exit code: {e.code}")
            ...     sys.exit(e.code)

            Integration with exception handling:

            >>> try:
            ...     downloader.download()
            ... except KeyboardInterrupt:
            ...     print("Download cancelled by user")
            ... except Exception as e:
            ...     print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            ...     # Error details are already logged by the method

        Monitoring and Debugging:
            The method provides extensive logging at multiple levels:
            - **INFO**: General progress and status information
            - **WARNING**: Non-critical issues and user interruptions
            - **ERROR**: Recoverable errors and retry attempts
            - **CRITICAL**: Unrecoverable errors requiring termination
            - **DEBUG**: Detailed internal state for troubleshooting

        Thread Safety:
            This method is not thread-safe and should only be called once per
            VideoDownloader instance. The internal AsyncOrchestrator handles
            concurrency through async/await patterns within a single thread.
            For multi-threaded applications, create separate VideoDownloader
            instances for each thread.

        Note:
            This method is designed to be called once per VideoDownloader instance
            and represents the complete lifecycle of a download session. Multiple
            calls may result in undefined behavior due to resource state management
            and configuration handling. Create a new VideoDownloader instance for
            each independent download session.

def main() -> None:
    """
    Main entry point function for command-line execution.

    This function serves as the primary entry point when the module is executed
    directly from the command line. It provides a clean interface for script
    execution and handles the complete lifecycle of a download session.

    The function creates a VideoDownloader instance with default configuration
    (parsed from command-line arguments) and initiates the download process.
    It's designed to be simple and straightforward for command-line usage.

    Process Flow:
        1. Create VideoDownloader instance with default configuration
        2. Parse command-line arguments automatically
        3. Initialize logging and internationalization
        4. Execute the download process
        5. Handle completion or errors appropriately

    Returns:
        None: This function operates through side effects and process exit codes.
             Success is indicated by normal completion, while errors result in
             non-zero exit codes.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: Raised by the VideoDownloader.download() method for critical
                   errors that require immediate termination. The exit code
                   indicates the type of failure.

    Side Effects:
        - Parses command-line arguments from sys.argv
        - Creates VideoDownloader instance with parsed configuration
        - Executes complete download process with all associated side effects
        - May exit the process with non-zero code on failure

    Example:
        Command-line usage:

        $ python main.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example"
        $ python main.py --help
        $ python main.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" --quality 720p

    Note:
        This function is specifically designed for command-line execution.
        For programmatic usage, create VideoDownloader instances directly
        rather than calling this function.
