Create ``xarray.DataArray`` from an IDS
=======================================

.. info::

    This lesson was written before :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray` was
    implemented. This lesson is retained for educational purposes, however we
    recommend to use :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray` instead of manually creating
    xarray ``DataArray``\ s.

    See also: :ref:`Convert IMAS-Python IDSs directly to Xarray Datasets`.

Let's start with an introduction of Xarray. According to `their website
<https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/why-xarray.html>`_ (where you
can also find an excellent summary of why that is useful):

.. quote::

    Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on
    top of raw NumPy-like multidimensional arrays, which allows for a more intuitive,
    more concise, and less error-prone developer experience.

In this lesson, we will use the :ref:`metadata <using metadata>` from the Data
Dictionary to construct a ``DataArray`` from an IDS.

.. note::

    This section uses the python package ``xarray``. This package can be installed by
    following `the instructions on their website
    <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/installing.html>`_.


Exercise 1: create a ``DataArray`` for ``profiles_1d/temperature``
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. md-tab-set::

    .. md-tab-item:: Exercise

        1.  Load the training data for the ``core_profiles`` IDS. You can refresh how to
            do this in the following section of the basic training material: :ref:`Open
            an IMAS database entry`.
        2.  Get the average ion temperature data of the first time slice of
            ``profiles_1d``.
        3.  To create a DataArray from this temperature data, we need to give the
            following items to ``xarray``:

            -   The data itself.
            -   The coordinates and their values as a Python dictionary
                ``{"coordinate_name": coordinate_value, [...]}``.
            -   Any additional attributes. For this example we add the ``units``.
            -   The name of the data.

            Get these values for our ``temperature`` array.
        4.  Create the ``xarray.DataArray``: :code:`xarray.DataArray(data,
            coords=coordinates, attrs=attributes, name=name)`. Print the data array.
        5.  Now we can use the ``xarray`` API. Let's try some examples:

            a.  Select all items where ``rho_tor_norm`` is between 0.4 and 0.6:
                ``temperature.sel(rho_tor_norm=slice(0.4, 0.6))``.
            b.  Interpolate the data to a different grid:
                ``temperature.interp(rho_tor_norm=numpy.linspace(0, 1, 11))``
            c.  Create a plot: ``temperature.plot()``

        This exercise was created before the implementation of
        :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray`. The original approach is available below
        for educational purposes.

Exercise 2: include the ``time`` axis in the ``DataArray``
----------------------------------------------------------

In the previous exercise we created a ``DataArray`` for a variable in one time slice of
the ``profiles_1d`` array of structures. When the grid is not changing in the IDS data
(``profiles_1d[i]/grid/rho_tor_norm`` is constant), it can be useful to construct a 2D
``DataArray`` with the ``time`` dimension:

.. md-tab-set::

    .. md-tab-item:: Exercise

        1.  Load the training data for the ``core_profiles`` IDS.
        2.  Get the average ion temperature data of the first time slice of
            ``profiles_1d``. Verify that the coordinates are the same for all time
            slices with ``numpy.allclose``.
        3.  Concatenate the data of all time slices: ``numpy.array([arr1, arr2, ...])``.
            Note that we have introduced an extra ``time`` coordinate now!
        4.  Create the ``DataArray`` and print it.
        5.  Now we can use the ``xarray`` API. Let's try some examples:

            a.  Select all items where ``rho_tor_norm`` is between 0.4 and 0.6:
                ``temperature.sel(rho_tor_norm=slice(0.4, 0.6))``.
            b.  Interpolate the data to a different grid:
                ``temperature.interp(rho_tor_norm=numpy.linspace(0, 1, 11))``
            c.  Interpolate the data to a different time base:
                ``temperature.interp(time=[10, 20])``
            d.  Create a 2D plot: ``temperature.plot(x="time",
                norm=matplotlib.colors.LogNorm())``

    .. md-tab-item:: Solution

        This exercise was created before the implementation of
        :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray`. Below code sample is updated to provide
        two alternatives: the first is based on :py:func:`imas.util.to_xarray`,
        the second is the original, manual approach.
