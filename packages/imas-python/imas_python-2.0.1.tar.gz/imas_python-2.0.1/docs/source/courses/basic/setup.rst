IMAS-Python 101: setup IMAS-Python
==================================

This course was written for IMAS-Python version 0.8.0 and requires an IMAS installation to
load IMAS data. IMAS-Python may be installed on your cluster, in which case you can do

.. code-block:: console

    $ module load IMAS-Python IMAS
    $ python -c 'import imas; print(imas.__version__)'
