# IMAS-Python

IMAS-Python (formerly known as IMASPy its for versions < 2) is a pure-python library to handle 
arbitrarily nested data structures. It is designed for, but not necessarily bound to, interacting 
with Interface Data Structures (IDSs) as defined by the Integrated Modelling & Analysis Suite (IMAS) 
Data Model.


## Install

Simply install IMAS-Python with ``pip``:
```bash
pip install imas-python
```
or with optional dependencies for netCDF and xarray support:
```bash
pip install imas-python[netcdf,xarray]
```

More details are described in the documentation generated from `/docs/source/installing.rst`.
The documentation is autogenerated from the source using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
and can be found at the [readthedocs](https://imas-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

To generate the documentation yourself, install the ``docs`` optional dependencies and do:
```bash
make -C docs html
```


## How to use

```python
import imas
factory = imas.IDSFactory()
equilibrium = factory.equilibrium()
print(equilibrium)

equilibrium.ids_properties.homogeneous_time = imas.ids_defs.IDS_TIME_MODE_HOMOGENEOUS
equilibrium.ids_properties.comment = "testing"
equilibrium.time = [0.01]

with imas.DBEntry("imas:hdf5?path=./testdb", "w") as dbentry:
    dbentry.put(equilibrium)
	
# or without imas_core dependency
with imas.DBEntry("./test.nc", "w") as dbentry:
    dbentry.put(equilibrium)

```

A quick 5 minutes introduction is available in the documentation generated from `/docs/sources/intro.rst`.
