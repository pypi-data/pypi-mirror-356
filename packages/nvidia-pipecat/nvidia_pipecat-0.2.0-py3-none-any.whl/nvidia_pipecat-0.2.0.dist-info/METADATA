# NVIDIA Pipecat

The NVIDIA Pipecat library augments [the Pipecat framework](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) by adding additional frame processors and services, as well as new multimodal frames to facilitate the creation of human-avatar interactions. This includes the integration of NVIDIA services and NIMs such as [NVIDIA Riva](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/index.html), [NVIDIA Audio2Face](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/audio2face-3d), and [NVIDIA Foundational RAG](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/build-an-enterprise-rag-pipeline). It also introduces a few processors with a focus on improving the end-user experience for multimodal conversational agents, along with speculative speech processing to reduce latency for faster bot responses. 

The nvidia-pipecat source code can be found in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/ace-controller). Follow [the documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/ace-controller-microservice/latest/index.html) for more details.
