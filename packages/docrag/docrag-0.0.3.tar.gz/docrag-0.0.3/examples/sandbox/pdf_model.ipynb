The chemical structure on the left contains carbon (C) and oxygen (O) atoms. The middle section represents the Chemical Element KG, which includes facts about the elements, such as their period number and metallicity. For example, it states that both C and O are in period 2 and are reactive nonmetals. The right side shows the chemical structure transformed into a knowledge graph, where C and O are nodes, and relationships like \"isPeriodOf\" and \"isMetallicityOf\" are represented as edges connecting the nodes to their corresponding properties.\\n\\nFigure 1: Chemical Element KG builds associations between\\natoms that are not directly connected by bonds but related in\\nfundamental chemical attributes, as denoted by red arrows.\\n\\n*Summary: Transformation of a chemical structure into a knowledge graph (KG) with facts about the elements, such as their period number and metallicity.*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Page 3\\n\\n## Figure Description\\n\\nThe figure illustrates a three-stage process involving knowledge-guided graph augmentation, knowledge-aware graph representation, and a contrastive objective. The process begins with an initial graph \\\\(G_i\\\\) which is then augmented using a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph. This augmentation results in a modified graph \\\\(G\\'_i\\\\). A similar process occurs for another graph \\\\(G_j\\\\), resulting in \\\\(G\\'_j\\\\).\\n\\nIn the second stage, the graphs \\\\(G_i\\\\) and \\\\(G_j\\\\) are processed by a GNN-based encoder \\\\(f(\\\\cdot)\\\\), producing representations \\\\(h_{G_i}\\\\) and \\\\(h_{G_j}\\\\) respectively. Similarly, \\\\(G\\'_i\\\\) and \\\\(G\\'_j\\\\) are processed by a KMPNN encoder \\\\(f\\'(\\\\cdot)\\\\), resulting in representations \\\\(h_{G\\'_i}\\\\) and \\\\(h_{G\\'_j}\\\\).\\n\\nFinally, in the third stage, the representations \\\\(h_{G_i}\\\\) and \\\\(h_{G_j}\\\\) are passed through a projection head \\\\(g(\\\\cdot)\\\\), yielding embeddings \\\\(z_i\\\\) and \\\\(z_j\\\\). The representations \\\\(h_{G\\'_i}\\\\) and \\\\(h_{G\\'_j}\\\\) are also passed through a projection head \\\\(g(\\\\cdot)\\\\), yielding embeddings \\\\(z\\'_i\\\\) and \\\\(z\\'_j\\\\). A contrastive objective is then applied, where \\\\(z_i\\\\) and \\\\(z\\'_i\\\\) are considered positive pairs (indicated by a tan arrow), and \\\\(z_j\\\\) and \\\\(z\\'_j\\\\) are considered hard negative pairs (indicated by a green arrow).\\n\\nThe figure also includes a legend indicating that the blue circles represent atoms, the orange circles represent attributes, the tan rectangles represent positive examples, and the green rectangles represent hard negative examples. The Chemical Element Knowledge Graph contains relationships such as (2, isPeriodOf, C), (Gas, isStateOf, Cl), (Pnictogen, isFamilyOf, N), and (DensGroup1, isDensityOf, N).\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: An illustrative example for KCL. We ignore edge directions in four molecular graphs due to space limitation (the direction of an edge between an attribute and an atom is from the former to the latter, while an edge between atoms is bidirectional).\\n\\nModule 1: Knowledge-guided graph augmentation converts the original molecular graph G into the augmented molecular graph G\\' based on Chemical Element KG. Module 2: Knowledge-aware graph representation captures representations from two graph views separately. Module 3: Contrastive objective trains the encoders and the projection head to maximize agreement between positives and disagreement between hard negatives (e.g., G; act as the hard negative of G₁) via a contrastive loss.\\n\\n*Summary: The figure depicts a three-stage process: knowledge-guided graph augmentation, knowledge-aware graph representation using GNN-based and KMPNN encoders, and a contrastive objective for learning embeddings. It uses a Chemical Element Knowledge Graph to augment initial graphs and employs positive and hard negative pairs in the contrastive learning phase.*\\n\\n| Category       | Count |\\n|----------------|-------|\\n| Elements       | 118   |\\n| Attributes     | 107   |\\n| Entities       | 225   |\\n| Relation Types | 17    |\\n| KG Triples     | 1643  |\\n\\nFigure 2: An illustrative example for KCL.
