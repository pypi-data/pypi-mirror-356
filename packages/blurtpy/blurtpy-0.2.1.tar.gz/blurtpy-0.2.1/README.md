Youâ€™ll also need to install espeak for voice output:
```bash
sudo apt install espeak
```
If espeak is not available, blurtpy will gracefully fall back to text output with a helpful warning.    

```bash
from blurt import say, notify_when_done, speak

say("Hello developer!")

@notify_when_done("Function complete")
def task():
    ...

with speak("Starting work", done="Work done"):
    ...
```
