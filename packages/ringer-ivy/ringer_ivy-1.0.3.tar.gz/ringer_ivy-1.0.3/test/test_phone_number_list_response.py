    This API provides endpoints for managing phone numbers within a Ringer Business account and its sites. Phone numbers are essential for making and receiving calls and can be routed to various features like devices, menus, or voicemail.  Functionality includes: - Listing phone numbers associated with a specific site. - Assigning (creating) a new phone number to a site. - Retrieving details of a specific phone number. - Updating a phone number's configuration (e.g., its routing destination). - Deleting/unassigning a phone number from a site. - Transferring a phone number between sites. - Listing available phone numbers for assignment to a site (from inventory or search). - Searching for available phone numbers based on criteria like area code, city, etc.
