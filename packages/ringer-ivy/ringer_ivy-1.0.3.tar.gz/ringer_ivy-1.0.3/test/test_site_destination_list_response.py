    Ringer Business API - Sites Management

    This API provides endpoints for managing Sites within a Ringer Business account. Sites are collections of telephony features and can represent physical locations, departments, or logical groupings of phone system behaviors.  Developers can use this API to: - List all sites for an account. - Create a new site. - Retrieve details of a specific site. - Update an existing site's configuration. - Delete a site (and its associated features). - Rebuild a site's configuration with the call processing system. - List potential destinations and failovers for site features.  Site management often involves configuring various telephony features, which will be detailed in separate feature-specific API documents (e.g., devices, phone numbers, menus).
