# HlsKit Contributor License Agreement

By contributing to or modifying HlsKit, you agree to the following terms:

1. **Collective Ownership**  
   The HlsKit project incorporates the original code and all contributions submitted directly to this repository as a collective work, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3). Once submitted, your contributions become part of the shared HlsKit ecosystem and cannot be reclaimed, reassigned, or withdrawn by any individual, legal entity, or group. Contributions to your own forks remain yours unless submitted here, at which point they join this collective whole under LGPLv3.

2. **Definition of Contribution**  
   You are considered a contributor to HlsKit if you modify the library in any form (including forks, wrappers, libraries, or extensions that alter its behavior), whether or not you submit your changes directly to this repository. All such modifications are part of the broader HlsKit ecosystem and are subject to this CLA.

3. **Distribution of Modifications**  
   If you distribute a modified version of HlsKit, you must:  
   - (a) License your modifications under LGPLv3, with source code available as required by the license.  
   - (b) Ensure your modifications are adoptable by the HlsKit ecosystem, meaning they are publicly available and compatible with other forks or the upstream project.

4. **Networked Use of Modifications**  
   If you use a modified version of HlsKit in a networked application (e.g., accessible over the internet), you must provide the source code of your modifications under LGPLv3 and notify the HlsKit project (e.g., via email to [higashikataengels@icloud.com]). This does not apply to the use of the unmodified library in proprietary software, which remains permissible under LGPLv3.

5. **Scope**  
   These terms apply to all contributions and modifications derived from the HlsKit project. The use of the unmodified library in proprietary software is governed solely by the LGPLv3.
