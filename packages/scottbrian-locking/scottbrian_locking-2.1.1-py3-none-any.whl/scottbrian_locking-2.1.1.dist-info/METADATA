Intro
=====

The SELock is a shared/exclusive lock that you can use to coordinate
read and write access to a resource in a multithreaded application.

:Example: use SELock to coordinate access to a resource

>>> from scottbrian_locking import se_lock as sel
>>> a_lock = sel.SELock()
>>> # Get lock in exclusive mode
>>> with sel.SELockExcl(a_lock):
...     msg = 'lock obtained exclusive'
>>> print(msg)
lock obtained exclusive

>>> # Get lock in shared mode
>>> with sel.SELockShare(a_lock):
...     msg = 'lock obtained shared'
>>> print(msg)
lock obtained shared
