    """Merge FlyWire neuron into FAFB CATMAID.

    This function (1) fetches a mesh from FlyWire, (2) turns it into a skeleton,
    (3) maps the coordinates to FAFB v14 space and (4) runs
    ``fafbseg.merge_neuron`` to merge the skeleton into CATMAID.

    Disclaimer:

     1. It is your responsibility to make sure that your export of FlyWire data
        does not conflict with the FlyWire community guidelines. Mass export of
        reconstructions is not OK!
     2. As with all imports to CATMAID, the importing user is responsible for
        the quality of the imported skeleton and to make sure no existing
        tracings (including annotations) are negatively impacted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id  :                int
                         ID of the FlyWire neuron you want to merge.
    target_instance :    pymaid.CatmaidInstance
                         Instance to merge the neuron into into.
    tag :                str
                         You personal tag to add as annotation once import into
                         CATMAID is complete.
    dataset :            str | CloudVolume
                         Against which FlyWire dataset to query::
                            - "production" (current production dataset, fly_v31)
                            - "sandbox" (i.e. fly_v26)
    assert_id_match :    bool
                         If True, will check if skeleton nodes map to the
                         correct segment ID and if not will move them back into
                         the segment. This is potentially very slow!
    drop_soma_hairball : bool
                         If True, we will try to drop the hairball that is
                         typically created inside the soma.
    **kwargs
                Keyword arguments are passed on to ``fafbseg.merge_neuron``.
