    This class represents the various derived classes that make up the
    binding to a @ref asset_management_system.

    It used by the dynamic plug-in discovery mechanism (@ref
    openassetio.pluginSystem.PythonPluginSystem) to instantiate the main
    classes in an implementation.

    The class will never be instantiated itself, so all functionality is
    via class methods.

    In order to register a new asset management system, simply place a
    python package on the appropriate search path, that has a top-level
    attribute called 'plugin', that holds a class derived from this.
