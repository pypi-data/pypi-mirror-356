kMCpy is an open source python based package intended to study the migration of atoms using the kinetic Monte Carlo technique. kMCpy provides an all python, systematic way to compute kinetic properties, which can be readily used for investigation, development, and prediction of new functional materials. 

This package includes a local cluster expansion model toolkit, a rejection-free kinetic Monte Carlo (rf-kMC) solver, and several python classes to extract ion transport properties such as diffusivities and conductivities. 

The local cluster expansion model toolkit can be used to fit a model from barrier calculated from first-principles or any other empirical methods. Following the training process the local cluster expansion model can compute migration barriers in crystalline materials within the transition state theory.

Some of the advantages of using this package are:

1. kMCpy is fully based on python and is modular which makes it developer centric thus facilitating quick addition of new features.

2. It is cross-platform and supports most operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3. Intensive kMC routines has been optimized into machine code in the fly using Numba (https://numba.pydata.org), which results in manifold increase in performance. 


This code has been recently used to explore the transport properties of Na-ion in NaSICON solid electrolyte (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32190-7).
Some of the relevant aspects of the code from the mentioned paper are shown below. 

The rf-kMC as a part of this code was used to model the Na-ion conductivity in the $\mathrm{Na_{1+x}Zr_{2}Si_{x}P_{3-x}O_{12}}$ which led to the discovery of maximum conductivity of the solid electrolyte is achieved for Na=3.4.

   Calculated Na+ diffusivity (a), conductivity (b), Haven's ratio (c) and averaged correlation factor (d) of $\mathrm{Na_{1+x}Zr_{2}Si_{x}P_{3-x}O_{12}}$ at several temperatures: 373 (dark blue circles), 473 (orange squares) and 573 (red triangles) K, respectively. In panel (b), the computed ionic conductivities are compared with the experimental values of this work (Supplementary Fig. 6) at selected temperatures. Experimental values in (b) from this work are depicted with light blue (373 K), yellow (473 K), and red (573 K) crosses belonging to the same $\mathrm{Na_{1+x}Zr_{2}Si_{x}P_{3-x}O_{12}}$ compositions but of pellets with different compacities (>70 and >90%, see legend).

# Installation
## Prerequisite
Check `pyproject.toml` for the required packages. The following Python packages are required to run kMCpy:
- pymatgen: **Windows users need to install Microsoft C++ build tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to compile pymatgen.**
- numba: for fast computation of kMCpy routines
- scikit-learn: for fitting local cluster expansion model
- pytest: for unit tests
- joblib
- glob2

> **⚠️ Warning for Windows users:**  
> You need to install [Microsoft C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to compile `pymatgen`.

## Command line environment
It is highly recommended to install kMCpy using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and use it with virtual environment.

```shell
uv venv #optional if you have already created a venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
uv pip install .
```

## For developers 
```shell
uv venv #optional if you have already created a venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --extra dev
uv pip install -e .
```

## Graphic user interface (GUI)
`wxpython` needs `conda` to be installed.
```shell
conda create -n kmcpy python wxpython -c conda-forge
conda activate kmcpy
pip install -r requirement_gui.txt .
```

## Build documentation
- Documentation is built using `pandoc` and `sphinx-build`.
- You can access the documentation from: `./docs/html/index.html`.
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --extra doc
python build_doc.py
```

# Run kMCpy
It is recommended to run kMCpy using the API. See examples for more details. A wrapper is also provided if you want to run kMCpy through command line only. 

- If GUI enabled: try `pythonw gui_wrapper.py` or `python gui_wrapper`
- If GUI not enabled: `wrapper.py PATH_TO_INPUT.json`
