xlrd is fixed at version 1.2 in Odoo. In the future, in v18,
we plan to switch from xlrd to openpyxl.

Also, we should seek a unified system, ideally an API, to download the
codes directly without manual file downloads.

There is unification at the European level here:

In the future, the process should be automated to update files without
manual intervention in the module.
